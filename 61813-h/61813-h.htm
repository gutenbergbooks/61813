<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>For literary conceits and dreams of authorship there is
no more powerful antidote than the tedium of official life. It
radically cures all such morbid propensities. This little book,
however, owes its inspiration to office routine. It was in
connection with official business that my interest in the subject
of water-worship was awakened about six years ago when in
my capacity as Municipal Secretary of Bombay I received
several protests against requisitions for the closing of wells.</p>

<p>In the course of its campaign against malaria the Municipality
had to call upon owners of wells breeding anopheles mosquitoes
to close them. The owners protested against these orders and
in their petitions they cited traditions concerning the sanctity
of water and related stories of spirits residing in the wells which
to one ignorant of the social organization and customs of the
people might appear to be nothing more than old wives’ tales
and babble, or mere pretexts to shirk civic responsibilities, but
which a student of traditional lore has learnt to prize as priceless
fragments of information concerning the condition of human
thought of bygone ages. Often during one’s investigation of
such local accounts one comes across examples where history is
in close contact with popular tradition, illustrating abundantly
the inherent value of what Sir Henry Maine slightingly called
“the slippery testimony concerning savages which is gathered
from travellers’ tales.” Looked at from that point of view,
the curious beliefs and customs referred to in those petitions
revealed divers elements of sociological and ethnological
importance leading back to the days of the ancestors of the
petitioners, and affording glimpses of remote, unexplored
periods of antiquity when people unknown to history dwelt in
the particular localities from which the petitioners hailed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
left behind them a heritage of their mental strivings and
conceptions concerning wells and springs and other natural
objects. All this local lore of wells established, beyond doubt,
the prevalence of water-worship amongst educated Hindus and
Parsis residing in Bombay. It was, however, a medley of many
divergent elements. To docket and classify all the constituent
elements of this folklore, to trace their origin and to throw fresh
light on the different stages of culture of the early settlers in the
island of Bombay, was a task far beyond my capacity. Nevertheless,
it seemed to me it would be a sin to allow such precious
gems of information to remain buried in the dusky archives of
the Municipality. I therefore culled from the official correspondence
such gems as I could lay my hands on, made personal
investigations about local wells, gathered additional information
and read a paper on the Folklore of Bombay Wells before the
Anthropological Society of Bombay on the 30th August 1916.</p>

<p>It was natural that my interest in the subject should grow
as I proceeded. What struck me most during my studies and
inquiries was the striking resemblance in the traditions, customs,
rites and ceremonies prevailing in India and those in vogue
in European countries. It was clear, moreover, that until
recently the cult of water flourished in the West in a more
primitive and much ruder form than in India. I was, therefore,
tempted to read before the Society a second paper on the subject
and this was followed by another on the rituals of water-worship
and the sundry offerings to water-spirits in East and
West.</p>

<p>It was impossible to bring within the range of these papers
all the materials I had collected. As the series was primarily
intended to expound the lore of wells only, a good deal remained
unsaid concerning the divine seas and springs and tanks and
cataracts. I, therefore, thought of completing the series and
publishing a volume embodying the varied water-cults, localising
and classifying them, and tracing, as far as possible, their genealogy
with a view to elucidating the early life of the people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
lived in the different localities from time to time and their relationship
with the ancestors of the long-forgotten races of other
climes in which such ideas and customs also prevailed. It
was a very ambitious project, but I was tempted to set about
it as in the bibliography of anthropological literature I could
not find a single volume specially devoted to the subject. I
was, however, unable to make much progress for some months
owing to other engagements.</p>

<p>A few days ago, when I was sitting on the Versova sands,
musing on life’s uncertainties and the vanity of human wishes,
recalling Tennyson’s words “so many worlds, so much to do, so
little done, such things to be,” methought I heard a water-nymph
questioning me from under the pale-green sea-groves:
“How many years wilt thou dream away before thou completest
that work? Why not immediately convey to thy readers
our invitation to the concerts of the nymphs?” At once I
recalled that eight years had rolled by since I had resolved to
complete another series of anthropological papers, <i>viz.</i>, Naming
Customs and Name Superstitions, just as I had thought of
elaborating the water-worship series, but that I had not been
able to take the work in hand in the midst of rapidly increasing
daily duties. What chance was there of better success in regard
to this new work? I, therefore, thought it advisable to publish
the papers as read before the Society without further delay.
Their publication in book-form has, however, necessitated a
somewhat unsatisfactory arrangement of chapters, and for this
and other demerits I owe an apology to the reader.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be said that such a gallimaufry of divers
tales and traditions, beliefs and superstitions long current
among different people in different countries treats the
reader to nothing new. It might also be urged that these traditions
and customs are mere survivals of a particular phase of
animism with which we are all familiar, that we all know
that from remote ages our ancestors have peopled trees and
plants, stocks and stones, dales and hills, and seas and springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
with all sorts of spirits, visible and invisible, and that it is upon
this spirit-world of prehistoric man that the primeval nature-worship
of our Aryan ancestors was based, upon which again
rest the religions and philosophies of the civilised world. This
is all very true. Veneration of water is undoubtedly a phase
of nature-worship. The student of history knows why from the
remotest ages Egypt, Babylon, India and China became centres
of population in the East and why the plains of Lombardy and
Netherlands attracted waves of humanity in the West. Naturally,
man gravitated towards districts where food was easily
obtainable. Valleys and plains fertilized by springs became his
home. Water to him was not only the prime necessity of life,
but the birth-place, so to say, of life. Moreover, the primitive
mind associated life with motion. It saw spirits in rolling stones
and swinging boughs. How could it remain unconscious of the
spirits controlling the many-sounding seas and bubbling rivers
and tumbling waterfalls? This is the <i>raison d’être</i> of the
universality of water-worship. No new work on the folklore
of wells is needed to tell us that, but, as I have just stated, such
folklore contains valuable details of social conditions and the
early history of races and if it puts in the hands of the student
of antiquities a key to the sealed book of some unexplored
stages of the cultural history, howsoever fragmentary, of
forgotten races, its publication would not be wholly in vain.</p>

<p>Races flourish and vanish, but their concepts and customs live
in their successors. These successors are not necessarily their
descendants. Often they are invaders and conquerors, sometimes
refugees, professing altogether different creeds, but with the
estates and objects which they inherit from their predecessors
they also inherit their mental strivings and traditions and
customs and hand these down from generation to generation.
These in their turn influence others, wherever they go. Thus
it is that we see ancient customs and ceremonies observed,
even to this day, with very little variation, by different communities,
even though separated by oceans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous illustrations may be given of this parallelism of
beliefs prevailing in different places and their persistence in
different culture eras. One remarkable instance is the preservation
of the bridge-sacrifice traditions. It is referred to by
Sir Laurence Gomme in <i>Folklore as an Historical Science</i> in
the course of his analysis of the legend of the Pedlar of Lambeth
and the treasure stories centering round London Bridge.
The bridge was the work of the Romans of Lundinium—a
marvellous enterprise in the eyes of the Celtic tribesmen who
believed that the building of the bridge was accompanied by
human sacrifice. This is confirmed by the preservation in
Wales of another tradition relating to the “Devil’s Bridge”
near Beddgelert. “Many of the ignorant people of the
neighbourhood believe that this structure was formed by
supernatural agency. The devil proposed to the neighbouring
inhabitants that he would build them a bridge across the pass
on condition that he should have the first who went over it
for his trouble. The bargain was made, and the bridge appeared
in its place, but the people cheated the devil by dragging
a dog to the spot and whipping him over the bridge.”
When the Calcutta authorities proposed to build a bridge over
the Hoogly River, the ignorant masses apprehended that the
first requirement would be a human sacrifice for the foundation.
The news went to England from the <i>London and China
Telegraph</i> from which the <i>Newcastle Chronicle</i> of 9th February
1889 copied the following statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The boatmen on the Ganges, near Rajmenal, somehow came
to believe that the Government required a hundred thousand
human heads as the foundation for a great bridge, and that
the Government officers were going about the river in search
of heads. A hunting party, consisting of four Europeans,
happening to pass in a boat, were set upon by the one hundred
and twenty boatmen, with the cry <i>Gulla Katta</i> or cut-throats,
and only escaped with their lives after the greatest difficulty.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirteen years ago, when the Sandhurst bridge was under
construction, a poor old man suspected of taking a child for
being interred in the foundations of the bridge was mercilessly
belaboured in the streets of Bombay. The boy was inclined
to play truant and did not wish to go home with the old
man. Some one started the canard that he had sold the
head of the child for bridge-sacrifice, the mob took it up and
only after great difficulty the unfortunate man was rescued by
the Police. Curiously enough, only a few days ago I gathered
from the story of a Mahomedan lad, who was brought to me for
admission to the home of the Society for the Protection of
Children, that another bridge-sacrifice panic had recently seized
the good people of Bankipur. The boy, named Abdulla Bakar,
aged 11, being an orphan, was working as a cooly in Bankipur.
He told the Society’s agent, and also repeated to me, that he
had been greatly alarmed by the report he had heard in the streets
of that city that children were buried alive in the foundations
of a bridge that was being built somewhere near.</p>

<p>No less persistent is the traditional dread of spirits haunting
pools and rapids. Until recently we used to hear in Bombay
that the spirits residing in the wells near the Bombay Gymkhana
waylaid and drowned people who disturbed them in the
evening. Similar beliefs are still current in England. In the <i>Transactions
of the Folklore Society</i> has been recorded the following
example of persistence of the superstitious dread of water:
A man was drowned in the Derwent in January 1904. “He
didna know Darrant,” commented an old neighbour, with a
triumphant tone in her voice, “he said it were nought but a
brook. But Darrant got him! They never saw his head, he
threw his arms up, but Darrant wouldna let him go. Aye,
it’s a sad pity—seven children! But he shouldna ha’ made
so light of Darrant. He knows now! Nought but a brook!
He knows now!” “She talked of the river as if it were a living
personage or deity,” wrote the narrator, “I could almost
imagine the next step would be to take it offerings.” Jenny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
Greenteeth still lurks under the weeds of stagnant pools in
Shropshire and Lancashire and in the following pages will be
found examples of numerous water-spirits residing in or hovering
round Indian wells and tanks.</p>

<p>Folklore tells us that mermaids threatened floods if offended
by drainage schemes. Would that some fair denizens of the
waters of Araby had raised up their heads from the <i>pātāls</i>
when the schemes for the drainage of Bombay were under
consideration and when Worli point was selected for the outfall!
On that occasion even God Varuna, the lord of all waters, and
the Nagas and Nagins, the semi-divine sovereigns of the watery
regions, half men and half serpents, and the whole band of sea-spirits
were mysteriously silent and forbearing, but the well-spirits
are not so tame. They will not allow another municipal
atrocity lying down. Some have exacted the toll of human
life, others have evinced their wrath by breaking open the
coverings enforced by the Municipality, while some weak spirits,
for whom the concrete covers have proved too strong, have been
haunting the neighbourhood and inducing the owners of wells
and, failing them, responsive neighbours, to re-open the wells.
Only a few weeks ago, a Hindu member of the Bombay
Municipal Corporation told me that a Parsi residing in a
house adjoining his property in Dhus Wadi assured him that
a <i>sayyid</i> residing in the well of his house, which had been closed
in compliance with a municipal requisition, had been visiting
the Parsi in dreams and imploring him to get the well opened,
promising him saintly favours. He could not understand why
the cabined spirit should not seek the assistance of the Hindu
inmates or of the Hindu owner of the very house in which the
well was situated, but go instead to the Parsi neighbour. The
reason, however, is not far to seek.</p>

<p>The Bombay Parsi is a born venerator of water. He may
be seen any day on the beach, dipping his fingers in the
water and applying it to his eyes and forehead, lifting his
hands in prayers and wafting his soul to the realms of the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
Unknown. To all that is pure, sublime and beautiful in the
universe the Zoroastrian paid willing homage. Accordingly, water-worship
was a general cult amongst the Parsis in their ancestral
home. It was, however, a means of looking up through
nature to nature’s God. It merely postulated the presence
of a beneficent spirit permeating water. There was no suggestion,
whatsoever, of water-goblins haunting wells and springs.
How, then, did the present-day Parsi come to imbibe the
belief in such minor deities and how did he come to give them
a local habitation and a name? This is a question of absorbing
interest from the point of view of the folklorist. India is <i>par
excellence</i> the land of goblindom and it is but natural that the
spirit-world of the Parsis should expand in the land of their
adoption. With their mind attuned to the worship of water they
came readily under the influence of the <i>genii locorum</i>. The most
curious feature, however, of this Parsi belief in Moslem water-spirits
is that amongst the Mahomedans themselves no such
belief prevails or ever did prevail. They believe, no doubt, in
saints who have endowed springs and wells, but no Mahomedan
<i>sayyid</i> or <i>pir</i> has or ever had his home or haunt in water. Neither
does a Mahomedan believe in any other benevolent or malevolent
indwelling spirit of the well. The installation of Mahomedan
saints in the wells of Parsi households is therefore an anthropological
puzzle for the solution of which we must make a joint
appeal to history and folklore. It is evidently a case of substitution
and amalgamation of beliefs and it is cases such as
these that call for research in the localisation of popular beliefs
and their ethnic genealogy. People inhabiting modern culture
areas have an anthropological as well as a national or political
history and without the anthropological history it is impossible
to explain the meaning and existence of a number of beliefs
and customs prevailing in a particular community. It is,
therefore, necessary to classify all the Indian cults of water
according to their ethnological and geographical distribution
and to carry on research in the genealogy of the different
conceptions and customs prevailing in different parts. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
way we may arrive at different historical landmarks, working
backwards from which we may get some glimpses of the
political, social, psychological and religious history of the older
races that lived in this country. Water-worship, like stone-worship,
is a non-Aryan custom and without some research
in the history of the non-Aryan races that dwelt in the land
before the advent of the Aryans it will not be possible to
account for the savagery of many of the forms and rituals of
this worship as it now prevails amongst the Aryan races.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have sought to indicate what scope
there is for such research work and I have devoted a special
chapter to Sir Laurence Gomme’s luminous analysis of the
water cults prevailing in Britain and its isles with a view to
indicating the methods of research adopted by him. If we
follow the same lines in tracing the ancestry of the Indian customs
and beliefs, we may hope to throw some fresh light on the
cultural history of the ancestors, or at all events the immediate
predecessors, of the people among whom we now find them
prevailing. I do not profess to have accomplished anything
of the kind in this book. It is really not want of time so
much as the consciousness of sheer inability to do justice to
the theme that has deterred me from launching upon a
scientific survey of the varying forms of water-worship. Circumstances
permitting, after further study and research, I may
venture to essay it and place before the public a more studied
and comprehensive volume on the subject, meanwhile this little
book will not have been published in vain if it leads some student
of anthropology to embark on such a survey and I shall
be better pleased indeed to see this fascinating subject comprehensively
dealt with by one of the masters of the science of
folklore.</p>

<p>I trust I have duly acknowledged, at the proper places, all
the authorities I have consulted. I cannot conclude, however,
without expressing my special indebtedness to the works of that
distinguished Town Clerk and student of local lore, the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Sir Laurence Gomme. My thanks are also due to my esteemed
teacher and friend, Mr. J. D. Bharda, for the interest he has
taken in this work and for his helpful suggestions when the
sheets were passing through the press.</p>

<span class="smaller">SANCTITY OF WATER.</span></h3>

<p>Time was when the whole earth, the fever-stricken isle of
Bombay included, was free from fevers. One unlucky day,
however, Daksha Prajapati and his son-in-law Shiva fell out
and their discord brought with it a whole crop of fevers. The
story runs that Daksha Prajapati once celebrated a great sacrifice
to which he did not invite Shiva. All humanity had to
suffer for this insult which greatly incensed Shiva whose breath
during those moments of fury emitted eight frightful fevers.</p>

<p>In the good old days, however, a magic thread (<i>dora</i>), or a
charm (<i>mantra</i>), was enough to scare the fever-spirit away.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
In obstinate cases, no doubt, the spirit had to be exorcised from
the body of the patient by a <i>Bhuva</i> or <i>Bhagat</i> and transferred
to some animate or inanimate object, or perhaps a cock or
a goat or a buffalo had to be sacrificed to propitiate the
disease-deity. That, however, was all. A special offering for
the Benares godling <i>Jvaraharísvara</i>, “the god who repels the
fever,” was <i>Dudhbhanga</i>, a confection of milk (<i>dudh</i>), leaves of
the hemp plant (<i>bhanga</i>) and sweets.</p>

<p>Of all such remedies and expedients the simplest and the
quaintest was that for driving the malaria fiend away. One
had only to listen to the story of <i>Ekānterio</i>, the spirit controlling
intermittent fever, and one got immunity for ever. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
legend runs that once a Bania, on his way to a village, came
across a banyan tree where he unyoked his bullocks and went
to a distance in search of water. <i>Ekānterio</i>, who resided in
this tree, carried away the Bania’s carriage together with
his family. The Bania was much surprised to miss them,
but he soon found out the author of the trick and pursued
<i>Ekānterio</i>. That fever-goblin, however, would not listen to
the Bania’s entreaties to return his carriage, and the matter
was at last referred for arbitration to Bochki Bai. She decided
in favour of the Bania, and confined <i>Ekānterio</i> in a bamboo
tube whence he was released on condition that he would never
attack those who listened to this story.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>To-day in our midst there are no such story-tellers, no such
Bhuvas and medicine-men, or, if there are any, they are seldom
given a chance. We rather like to listen to the stories of the
microscope and pin our faith to the doctor and the scientist.
These men of science scent <i>Ekānterio</i> in every anopheles mosquito
and tell us that malarial fever is conveyed from one
human being to another by the bite of this ubiquitous insect.
Therefore, if we wish to stamp out malaria, we must wage a
crusade against this vast army of <i>Ekānterio</i>. It is well
known that these mosquitoes breed in water and that they
are particularly fond of well water. One of the measures that
the Bombay Municipality has therefore to enforce in connection
with its campaign against malaria is the closing of wells
containing the larvæ of these mosquitoes. In the early stages
of the campaign, however, it gave rise to vehement protests.
These were prompted not merely by utilitarian motives, but
also by religious sentiments and supernatural beliefs. The
aggrieved parties gave chapter and verse to show that their
scriptures enjoined the use of well water, and well water only,
in connection with divers ceremonies, and they further relied
on several popular beliefs investing the water of wells with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
supernatural efficacy. We shall record a few typical examples
of such beliefs and convictions and a few traditions concerning
several wells of Bombay, culled from the official
correspondence on the subject and other sources, and we shall
see in the course of our survey that these merely present, with
a little local colouring, the particular primitive phase of nature-worship
under which all nations inhabiting the globe have held
in the past, and do hold to a certain extent even now, springs
and wells in religious reverence and awe, regarding the water
thereof as a living organism or as a dwelling-place of spirits.</p>

<p>When the owner of an objectionable well is asked by the Municipality
either to fill up the well or to cover it, he invariably
prefers the second alternative, provided he is allowed to cover the
well with wire gauze or at least to provide a wire gauze trap-door
for drawing water. The reason given in most of the cases
is that according to tenets and established customs the water
required for religious ceremonies must be exposed directly to
the rays of the sun and that water not so exposed is rendered
unfit for the purpose. The Parsis cite their scriptures and the
Hindus theirs in support of this contention. It is unnecessary
for our present purpose to quote the injunctions of the
scriptures, but it is interesting to note how they are construed
and understood.</p>

<p>When the Health Officer, Dr. J. A. Turner, was overwhelmed
by all sorts of religious objections to the closing of wells, he
consulted recognised authorities on Parsi religion as to the precise
requirements of the scriptures and the manner in which the
object of the Department could be carried out without wounding
the religious susceptibilities of the Parsis. Dr. J. J. Modi gave
his opinion as follows, referring to a ceremony of peculiar
interest to the students of scriptural lore:—</p>

<p>“As, according to Parsi books, the sun is considered to be a
great purifier, it is required that the well must be exposed to the
rays of the sun. So a well hermetically covered with wood or
metal is prohibited. But one ‘hermetically covered with wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gauze of very fine mesh,’ as suggested by you, would serve the
purpose and would, I think, serve the Scriptural requirement.
As to the question of drawing water from such a well, a part of
the three principal ceremonies performed at a Fire Temple is
known as that of <i>Jor-melavvi</i> (lit. to unite the Zaothra or ceremonial
water with its source). As we speak of ‘dust to dust,’
<i>i.e.</i>, one born from dust is in the end reduced to dust, this part
of the ceremonial which symbolizes the circulation of water from
the earth to the air and from the air to the earth requires what
we may, on a similar analogy, speak of as the transference of
‘water to water.’ It requires that a part of the water drawn
for ceremonial purposes from the well must be in the end returned
to its source—the well. So, the provision of the air-pump, will
not, I am afraid, meet all the requirements. I would therefore
suggest that in addition to the hand-pump, a small close-fitting
opening, also made of wire-gauze of fine mesh, may be provided.”</p>

<p>Shams-ul-ulma Darab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana also gave his
opinion to the same effect and the recommendation of these two
scholars was accepted by the Department.</p>

<p>No Hindu <i>savant</i> appears to have been consulted on the
subject, but a few gems selected from the petitions and
protests received by the Municipal authorities will throw some
light on the traditions and customs of the different Hindu sects.
In a letter to the Standing Committee the Trustees of the
Derasar Sadharan Funds of the temple of Shri Anantnathji
Maharaj represented that according to the scriptures of the
Jains water used for religious ceremonies “must be drawn
<i>at one stretch</i> from a well over which the rays of the sun and
the light of the moon fall constantly and which must therefore
be open to the sky and no other water could be used at such
ceremonies.”</p>

<p>In another letter to the Committee Messrs. Payne &amp; Co., Solicitors,
wrote on behalf of their client Mr. Kikabhoy Premchand:
“Our client is a staunch Hindu of old idea and he requires the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
use of water from <i>seven</i> wells for religious ceremonies. For this
purpose he uses the two wells in question and has to go to neighbouring
properties to make up the full number of seven wells.
Water drawn by means of a pump cannot be used for religious
purposes and it is absolutely necessary that both the wells should
be provided with trap-doors.”</p>

<p>Even a trap-door would not satisfy the scruples of a large
number. Messrs. Mehta, Dalpatram and Laljee, Solicitors,
represented that the Marjadis never used pipe water, and they
observed: “According to the Marjadi principles if any pot
containing water touches any part of the trap-door, the water
cannot be used for any purpose and the pot must be placed in
fire and purified before it can be used again. As, however, it is
exceedingly difficult whilst drawing water to prevent the vessel
from coming into contact with the trap-door, the provision of
such door instead of being a convenience is the cause of much
needless irritation and annoyance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goculdas Damodar went a step further and urged that his
Marjadi tenants “were drawing water out of the well only in
sackcloth buckets and any other means would conflict with
their religious scruples.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sunderrao D. Navalkar raised a further objection. “By
asking me to cover the well,” wrote he, “you will be interfering
in our religious ceremony of lighting a lamp in the niche in the
well and performing other ceremonies regarding it.”</p>

<p>The least objectionable expedient for protecting wells from
the malarial mosquito was to stock them with fish. In many
cases it was cheerfully resorted to as an experimental measure
for killing the larvæ. But even this simple remedy was not
acceptable to some. In objecting to it a member of the Jain
community submitted that the fish would devour the larvæ
and that it was against his religion to do any harm to insect
life. It, however, required no very great efforts of casuistry
to induce him to believe that it would be no transgression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i>his</i> part if he merely allowed the Department to put the fish
into the well.</p>

<p>This incident reminds one of the beliefs current among the
great unwashed sect of the Jains known as the <i>Dhundhias</i>.
These tender-hearted people consider it a sin to wash, as water
used for bathing or washing purposes is likely to destroy the
germs in it. India is indeed a country of bewildering paradoxes.
The Hindu <i>Shastras</i> enjoin a complete bath not merely if one
happens to touch any untouchable thing or person, but even if
one’s ears are assailed by the voice of a non-Hindu (<i>Yavana</i>).
Nevertheless, in this bath-ridden country of religious impressionability
and, what may appear to the western people, hyperbolic
piety, people like the <i>Dhundhias</i> abound. There are also
certain Banias who, during the whole of the winter, consider
it useless to have anything to do with water beyond washing
their hands and face.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>With this practice of abstinence from washing may be compared
the custom prevailing all over Greece of refraining from
washing during the days of the Drymais. No washing is done
there during those days because the Drymais, the evil spirits
of the waters, are supposed to be then reigning.</p>

<p>Let us now turn from these quaint religious customs concerning
the use of well water to some of the beliefs of the people in
the existence of spirits residing in the wells of Bombay.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">WATER SAINTS.</span></h3>

<p>When owners of houses are asked to fill up their wells or to
cover them, they generally apply for permission to provide a
wire-gauze cover or a trap-door. In not a few of these cases
the application is prompted either by a desire “to enable the
spirits in the well to come out,” or by the fear “lest the spirits
should bring disaster” if they were absolutely shut up.</p>

<p>Mr. Gamanlal F. Dalal, Solicitor, once wrote on behalf of a
client, regarding his well in Khetwadi Main Road:—</p>

<p>“My client and his family believe that there is a saintly being
in the well and they always personally see the angelic form of the
said being moving in the compound at night and they always
worship the said being in the well, and they have a bitter experience
of filling the well or closing it up hermetically because in or
about the year 1902 my client did actually fill up the well to its
top but on the very night on which it was so filled up all the
members of my client’s family fell dangerously ill and got a dream
that unless the well was again re-opened and kept open to the
sky, they would never recover. The very next day thereafter
they had again to dig out the earth with which the well had
been filled up and they only recovered when the well was
completely opened to the sky.”</p>

<p>A Parsi gentleman, who owns a house on Falkland Road,
was served with a notice to hermetically cover the well. He
complied with the requisition. After about a month he went
to Dr. K. B. Shroff, Special Officer, Malaria, complaining
that he had lost his son and that he had himself been suffering
from palpitation of the heart. This he attributed to the
closing of the well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, a Parsi lady in Wanka Moholla, Dhobi Talao,
informed Dr. Shroff that since the closing of the well in her
house her husband had been constantly getting ill. Likewise,
a Parsi gentleman living in the same locality complained
that he was struck with paralysis for having sealed his well
hermetically.</p>

<p>These spirits are believed to influence not only the health and
strength of their victims but also their fortunes. In Edwardes
Theatre on Kalbadevi Road there was a well, which was filled
in by its considerate owner of his own accord during the construction
of the building. Subsequently, the owner went to the
Malaria Officer and informed him that no Indian Theatrical
Company would have his theatre as the proprietors had a
sentimental objection pertaining to the well, and that it was
believed that European Companies also did not make any profit,
as the spirit in the well had been playing mischief. He therefore
applied for permission to re-open the well, promising at the
same time that he would cover it over again so as to let the
spirit have “a free play in the water.” This request was
granted and the work was carried out accordingly. “Recently
I was informed,” says Dr. Shroff, “that the theatre was doing
better.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the pent-up spirits are not so vindictive. Instead
of ruining the owners of the wells in which they are shut up,
they vent their ire by merely breaking open the barriers. A
Parsi lady in Cowasji Patel Street, Fort, owned a large well
about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The Departmental deities
ordered that the well should be covered over. After half the
work of covering the well had been done, the concrete gave
way. The lady went running to the Malaria Officer urging that
that was the result of offending the presiding spirit of the
well and imploring him to cancel the requisition.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Malaria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Officer, however, remained unmoved by the fear of rousing the
ire of the water wraith and the dejected lady left his house
greatly incensed and probably firmly convinced that the wrath
of the spirit would soon be visited on that callous Officer. He is,
however, still hale and hearty. What he did to appease the
spirit or what amulet he wears to charm the water-goblins
away, is not known. However, this much is certain, that he
has not escaped the furious cannon-fire of all the well-worshippers
in Bombay during the last four years.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the attitude of hardened scientists in
this matter, there is no doubt that these well-spirits are
everywhere held by the people in great reverence and awe.
Whether one believes in their existence, or is inclined to be
sceptical on that point, wells supposed to harbour spirits are
scrupulously left undisturbed. Mr. Rustomji Byramji Jeejeebhoy,
whose family is known both for munificence and culture,
wrote in the following terms with regard to a well in Alice
Building, Hornby Road:—</p>

<p>“There is a superstition connected with the well. It is well-known
all over this part of the town that the well is said to
be a sacred well and much sanctity is attached to it. Out of
deference to this superstition, I had in designing Alice Building
to so design it as to leave the well alone. To me personally
the well is of no use, but those who believe in the superstition
come and pray near the well and present offerings of flowers
and cocoanuts to it.”</p>

<p>Not only owners of wells but also building contractors are
averse to disturbing water-spirits. When the Parsi contractor
who built the Alice Buildings had done work worth about
Rs. 35,000, he was informed that it had been proposed that the
well had better be filled up. He said he was prepared to give
up the work and forego all his claims rather than lay irreverent
hands on that sacred well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Once you instal a natural object in the position of a deity,
the idea that the deified power demands offerings and can be
easily cajoled invariably follows, probably based on the conviction
that every man has his price! Offerings to well-spirits
are, therefore, believed to insure good luck and to avert calamities.
One day a Parsi lady went to Dr. Shroff in great excitement
and begged of him not to insist on the well of her house
in Charni Road being closed. The well, she urged, was held in
great reverence by people of all communities. Only the day
previous, while she was driving in a carriage to the house to
offer a cocoanut, sugar and flowers to the well, she narrowly
escaped a serious accident, thanks to the protection offered by
the well-spirit.</p>

<p>Two sisters owned a house in Dhunji Street near Pydhowni.
They were served with a notice to cover the well of the house.
One of the sisters went running to the Malaria Officer beseeching
him to cancel the notice. She said that her invalid sister
strongly believed in the efficacy of the worship of the well and
never went to bed without worshipping it and offering it
flowers. “My poor sister would simply go mad if she sees
the well covered over,” she cried, and she would not leave
Dr. Shroff’s office until that unchivalrous officer left her alone
and slipped into another room.</p>

<p>Several wells are believed to harbour spirits possessing occult
powers and faculties for giving omens. One such oracular
well may be seen in Ghoga Street, Fort. The owner of the
house, a Parsi, was allowed, in the first instance, to stock the
well with fish so as to clear it of the malaria mosquitoes.
This, however, failed to give satisfactory results and there was
no alternative but to demand a covering. The owner on the
other hand pleaded that the well had been held in great veneration
by all classes of people and had so high a reputation for
divination that many persons visited it at midnight to “enquire
about their wishes.” “About eight to twelve ladies (of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
none should be a widow) stand surrounding the well at midnight
and ask questions. If any good is going to happen, fire
will be seen on the surface of the water.” The owner assured
Dr. Shroff that he himself had been an eye-witness to these
phenomena.</p>

<p>Indian folklore abounds in stories belonging to the same
group. Neither are such stories unknown to the European
folklorist. We shall notice in due course several oracular and
wishing wells in India and other countries, but the ceremony
described by the Parsi owner is purely local and typical. So
far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no parallel for
it in the literature of well-worship. Peculiar also is the hour
fixed for the ceremony. Generally, visiting wells in the midnight
or even midday is believed to bring disasters. It seems,
however, from an account of a rite described by Miss Burne
in Shropshire Folklore that anyone wishing to resort to
St. Oswall’s Well at Oswestry had also to go to the well
at midnight. The ceremony was of course different. It simply
required that the votary had to take some water up in the
hand and drink part of it, at the same time forming a wish
in the mind, and to throw the rest of the water upon a
particular stone at the back of the well. If he succeeded in
throwing all the water left in his hand upon that stone without
touching any other spot, his wish would be fulfilled.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">PENALTY FOR DEFILEMENT.</span></h3>

<p>A tenant of the same house in Ghoga Street informed
Dr. Shroff that a cooly spat on the pavement surrounding the
oracular well with the result that he died instantly on the spot
for having defiled the holy ground. This reminds me of a
story related to me about three years ago of a European
girl who took suddenly ill and died within a day or two after
she had kicked aside a stone kept near the pavement of a well
in Loveji Castle at Parel. On this stone people used to put
their offerings to the saintly spirit of the place known by
the name of Kaffri Bâwâ. Many are the stories I have heard
of this spirit from a lady who spent her youth in Loveji
Castle, but as this was a tree-spirit and not a well-spirit, those
tales would be out of place here.</p>

<p>As well-water is used for religious ceremonies, wells and
their surroundings are generally kept clean by the Parsis and
Hindus alike, but there is a further incentive to cleanliness in
the case of wells which are regarded as dwelling-places of
spirits. It is a common conviction that any act of defilement,
whether conscious or unconscious, offends the spirits and all
sorts of calamities are attributed to such acts. At the junction
of Ghoga Street and Cowasjee Patel Street stands the once
famous house of Nowroji Wadia. Some years ago the property
changed hands. Certain alterations were made in the building
and in consequence a place was set apart close to the well
for keeping dead bodies before disposal. This brought disasters
after disasters. Deaths after deaths took place in the
house and bereavements after bereavements ruined the owner’s
family. Too late in the day was it realized that the nymphs
living in the well should not have been thus insulted. Once
a well in Barber Lane overflowed for days together, emitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
foul water. It did not occur to anyone to ascribe this to
the sewer-sprite who had just commenced his pranks in
Bombay. Instead, the mischief was unanimously fathered
on a Parsi cook and his wife who used to sleep near the
parapet of the well.</p>

<p>From ancient times contiguity of a corpse to water has been
regarded as a source of defilement. In “Primitive Semitic Religion
To-day” (1902), Professor Samuel Curtiss says that he was
told by Abdul Khalil, Syrian Protestant teacher at Damascus,
that “if a corpse passes by a house, the common people pour the
water out from the jars.” With this idea of pollution of water
was blended the conviction that the defilement of the water of
a well or spring was tantamount to the defilement of the
spirits or saints residing near them. Once two sects of Mahomedans
in Damascus fell out. One section held the other
responsible for the displeasure of a saint on the ground that it
had performed certain ablutions in the courtyard of his shrine
and that “the dirt had come on the saint to his disgust.”</p>

<p>In Brittany it is still a popular belief that those who pollute
wells by throwing into them rubbish or stones will perish by
lightning.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the prologue to <i>Chrétiens Conte du Graal</i> there
is an account, seemingly very ancient, of how dishonour to the
divinities of wells and springs brought destruction on the rich
land of Logres. The damsels who resided in these watery
places fed travellers with nourishing food until King Amangons
wronged one of them by carrying off her golden cup. His men
followed his evil example, so that the springs dried up, the grass
withered, and the land became waste.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Before the well of Nowroji Wadia’s house was unwittingly
defiled, the presiding fairies of the well used to sing and play
in it, but this entertainment ceased after the place had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
polluted. Another well, famous for the concerts of the nymphs,
was a well belonging to the Baxter family in Bhattiawad.
There, too, the water damsels regaled the ears of the inmates with
music. I say this on the authority of an old lady who used to
enjoy those subterranean melodies.</p>

<p>There is a fountain called “the pure one,” in Egypt. If
anyone that is impure through pollution or menstruation
touches the water, it begins at once to stink, and does not
cease until one pours out the water of the fountain and cleans
it. Then only it regains its fine smell.</p>

<p>Akin to this tradition is the Esthonian belief concerning the
sanctity of water. In Esthonia there is a stream Wohhanda
which has long been the object of reverence. No Esthonian
would fell any tree that grew on its banks or break any reed
that fringed its watercourse. If he did, he would die within
the year. The brook was purified periodically and it was
believed that if dirt was thrown into it, bad weather would
follow. The river-god resident in the stream was in the habit
of occasionally rising out of it and those who saw him described
him as a little man in blue and yellow stockings. Like
other river wraiths, whom we shall accost later, this water-sprite
also demanded human sacrifices, and tradition records
offerings of little children made to Wohhanda.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> When a German
landowner ventured to build a mill and dishonour the
water, bad seasons followed year after year, and the country-people
burned down the abominable thing.</p>

<p>A strange variant of the popular belief concerning pollution of
wells is found in the curious custom of deliberately defiling
wells with the object of disturbing the water-spirit and thus
compelling him to produce rain. It was a common belief
among several nations that one of the ways of constraining
the rain-god was to disturb him in his haunts. Thus when rain
was long coming in the Canary Islands, the priestesses used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to beat the sea with rods to punish the water-spirit for his
niggardliness. In the same way the Dards, one of the tribes
of the <i>Hindu-Kush</i>, believe that if a cow-skin or anything impure
is placed in certain springs, storm will follow. In the mountains
of Farghana there was a place where it began to rain as
soon as anything dirty was thrown into a famous well. In his
famous work on the Chronology of Ancient Nations, <i>Athár-ul-Bakiya</i>,
Albiruni refers to this phenomenon and asks for an
explanation. “And how,” he inquires, “do you account for
the place called “the shop of <i>Solomon</i>, the son of David,” in
the cave called Ispahbadhan in the mountain of Tâk in Tabaristan,
where heaven becomes cloudy as soon as you defile it
by filth or by milk, and where it rains until you clean it
again? And how do you account for the mountain in the
country of the Turks? For if the sheep pass over it, people
wrap their feet in wool to prevent their touching the rock of
the mountain. For if they touch it, heavy rain immediately
follows.” These things, says the author, are natural peculiarities
of the created beings, the causes of which are to be traced back
to the simple elements and to the beginning of all composition
and creation. “And there is no possibility that our knowledge
should ever penetrate to subjects of this description.”</p>

<p>This doctrine of negation of knowledge is typical of Persian
poets and philosophers. The poet Fakhra Razi has beautifully
expressed the idea in the following words:—“I thought and
thought each night and morn for seventy years and two, but
came to know this, that nothing can be known.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">QUAINT PARSI BELIEFS.</span></h3>

<p>Close by Nowroji Wadia’s house was another habitat of
spirits. The owner of the house, a Parsi lady, was asked to cover
it. In view of the sad experience of the fate of the owner of
the neighbouring house she was reluctant to do anything
that might offend the spirits, but the Malaria Department
was insistent. She therefore first implored the presiding deities
of the well to forgive her as she had no option in the matter,
and then consented to cover the well provided a wire-gauze trap-door
was allowed so as not to interfere with the work of worship.
I understand that on every full moon eve she opens the trap-door,
garlands the well and offers her <i>puja</i> there.</p>

<p>Further down the same street, once renowned for the abodes
of Parsi <i>Shethias</i>, is a house belonging to a well-known Parsi
family. A well in this house was and still is most devoutly
worshipped by the inmates of the house. I hear from a very
reliable source that whenever any member of the family got
married, it was the practice to sacrifice a goat to the well-spirit,
to dip a finger in the blood of the victim and to anoint the
bride or bridegroom on the forehead with a mark of the blood.
Once however this ceremony was overlooked and, as fate would
have it, the bridegroom died within forty days.</p>

<p>This practice of besmearing the forehead with the blood
of the sacrifice is a survival of primitive ideas concerning
blood-shedding and blood-sprinkling, the taking of the blood
from the place where the sacrifice was given being regarded
as equivalent to taking the blessing of the place and putting
it on the person anointed with the blood. Thus when an
Arab matron slaughters a goat or a sheep vowed in her son’s
behalf, she takes some of the blood and puts it on his skin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Similarly, when a barren couple that has promised a sacrifice
to a saint in return for a child is blest with the joys of parenthood,
the sacrifice is given and the blood of the animal is put
<i>on the forehead</i> of the child.</p>

<p>Remarkable as is the survival of this primitive ritual in
Bombay and its prevalence amongst people such as the Parsis,
there is nothing very extraordinary about it. A little patch
of savagery as it appears to be in the midst of fair fields and
pastures new of western culture, it merely affords an illustration
of the fact that localities preserve relics of a people much
older than those who now inhabit them. It also shows that
various systems of local fetichism found in Aryan Countries
merely represent the undying beliefs and customs of a primitive
race which the Aryans eventually incorporated into their own
beliefs and rituals, for it will be seen as we proceed that in
India as in Great Britain the entire cult of well-worship was
imbibed rather than engendered by Aryan culture.</p>

<p>What, however, is most extraordinary is that of all the communities
in Bombay the Parsis show the greatest susceptibility
to these beliefs. Amongst the Hindus worship of water
is, no doubt, universal. Belief in spirits is also general amongst
them. Amongst these spirits there are water-goblins also,
<i>Jalachar</i>, as contrasted with <i>Bhuchar</i>, spirits hovering on earth,
mostly inimical, <i>mâtâs</i> and <i>sankhinis</i>, <i>bhuts</i>, and <i>prets</i> who hover
round wells and tanks, particularly the wayside ones, and
drown or enter the persons of those who go near their haunts.
Many of these goblins are the spirits of those who have met with
an accidental death or the souls that have not received the
funeral <i>pindas</i> with the proper obsequies. The Hindus believe
that these fallen souls reside in their <i>avagati</i>, or degraded condition,
near the scene of their death and molest those who
approach it. Almost all the old wells in the Maidan were in
this way believed to be the haunts of such spirits who claimed
their annual toll without fail. Thus it was believed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the well that stood in the rear of the Bombay Gymkhana must
needs have at least three victims, and sure enough there were
at least three cases of suicide in that well during a year! However,
so far as domestic well-spirits are concerned, while
almost all the wells of a Parsi house were until recently and
many of them still are under the protection of a <i>Bâwâ</i>, or
<i>Sayyid</i>, or <i>Pir</i>, or <i>Jinn</i>, or <i>Pari</i>, or other spirits, one rarely
comes across such wells in Hindu household. Wells are worshipped
by the Hindus no doubt, without exception, but it is
the sacred character of the water that accounts for the worship,
not the belief in the existence of well-spirits. Again, as a result
of my investigations, I find that the worship of wells amongst
the Parsi community is in some cases much ruder and
more primitive than amongst the Hindus. What can be the
explanation for it? Is it simply a continuation of their own
old beliefs in the land of their adoption? Is it merely old wine
in new bottles?</p>

<p>Water-worship was, no doubt, a general cult with the Parsis
in their ancestral home. Of the antiquity of this worship
amongst them we have ample evidence in their scriptures. In
the <i>Aban Yesht</i> the spring is addressed as a mighty goddess,
<i>Ardevi Sura Anahita</i>, strong, sublime, spotless, erroneously
equated by some authors with the Mylitta of the Babylonians
and the Aphrodite of the Greeks. Ahurarmazda calls upon
Zarathushtra to worship <i>Ardevi Sura Anahita</i>:—</p>

<p>The chariot of <i>Banu Ardevi Sura</i> is drawn by four white
horses who baffle all the devils. Ahuramazda is said to have
worshipped her in order to secure her assistance in inducing
Zarathushtra to become his prophet, and the example set by
Him was followed by the great kings and heroes of ancient Iran.
It is conceivable that this tribal cult accompanied the devout
descendants of the ancient Persians wherever they went and
that with their mind attuned to the worship of water they
readily came under the influence of the <i>genii locorum</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
different parts of this country and adopted some of the local
rituals of the people who resided there before them. But the
question then arises, who were the people from whom they
borrowed these beliefs and rituals? Most of the guardian angels
of their wells point to a Mahomedan origin, and yet amongst
the followers of Islam well-worship is conspicuous by its
absence. They have, no doubt, their <i>Sayyids</i> and <i>Pirs</i> in abundance,
almost every shrine of theirs has its presiding saint,
but they scarcely believe in any spirit residing in wells. In
fact, one may safely say that well-worship amongst these people
has died out, if ever it did exist before. During my investigation
I have not come across a single case of such worship
amongst them and all the Mahomedans whom I have consulted
testify to the absence of these beliefs among them. How then,
do we account for the Mahomedan patron saints of the wells of
Parsi houses? It clearly cannot be a case of preservation of
old wine in new jars. The intensely local colouring does not
warrant any such assumption. There are distinctly non-Parsi
ingredients in it. From whom and how did they get these?
Well-spirits, like tree-spirits, form no part of any tribal cult.
They are essentially local in nature and the subject needs
careful research in the localisation of beliefs and the genealogy
of folklore. We shall advert to this subject again,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> meanwhile
let us record a few more instances of sanctified wells in Bombay.</p>

<p>A well of which I heard during my childhood several
thrilling stories of a somewhat singular type was situated in a
house in Nanabhoy Lane, Fort, opposite the Banaji Fire-Temple,
which belonged to my great grand-mother. It was believed
to be the abode of a kind-hearted <i>Sayyid</i> (Mahomedan saint)
who used to watch the health and fortunes of the inmates of
the house. Women in labour preferred for confinement no other
place to this auspicious house always mercifully protected
by that guardian angel. It is said that he used to come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the well regularly and that his presence was known
by the ecstatic possession of a Parsi woman who used to live
on the ground floor. A big basin of <i>maleeda</i> (confection of
wheat flour) was offered to him by the ladies. It was emptied
in a few moments. The inmates of the house related to the
saint all their difficulties and each one got a soothing reply and
friendly hints through the lips of the medium. A young lady
used to suffer from constant headache. Her grand-mother
one day asked the <i>Sayyid</i> what to do to cure the ailment. He
gave her a betel-nut and told her that it should always be kept
by the girl with her. This was done and she never suffered
from headache again. An old inmate of the house was once
seriously ill. All hopes of recovery were abandoned, but the
saint came to his rescue and advised the relatives as to what
they should do to propitiate the sea furies who wanted to
devour the man. After the furies were propitiated as advised,
the man recovered.</p>

<p>One or two more stories of Bombay wells known after the
names of the saintly spirits residing in them may be noted.
The Gunbow Lane is known after the famous well in the locality.
It is generally believed that the well was sacred to the
Saint (<i>bâwâ</i>) Gun who resorted to it. The Bombay City
Gazetteer, however, informs us that “the curious name <i>Gunbow</i>
is probably a corruption of <i>Gunba</i>, the name of an ancestor of
Mr. Jagannath Shankersett.” Old records show that Gunba
Seti or Gunba Shet settled in Bombay during the first quarter of
the 18th century and founded a mercantile firm within the Fort
walls. This Gunbow well was so big that it was believed that a
man could swim from its bottom to another in the compound of
the Manockji Seth Wadi about 500 feet away. Report has it
that swimmers even used to find their way as far as the wells
on the Maidan beyond Hornby Road. When it was proposed
to fill in the well, strong representations were made to the
effect that an opening for the well spirit should be kept, and
a portion was left open for years. This too has been now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
covered over, but people still take their offerings to the
site. In the same way, a well in the lane by the side of the
Manockji Seth’s Agiary leading to Mint Road, which has been
covered over, is seen strewn with flowers and other offerings.</p>

<p>Another well in Ghoga Street was believed to be the dwelling
place of a Mahomedan saint, <i>Murgha Bâwâ</i>. “Murgha”
is believed to be a corruption of Yusuf Murgay, who owned
houses in the street which was also known after his name as
<i>Murgha Sheri</i>. An esteemed friend, who used to reside in
the house containing this well, tells me that the well was held
in great reverence by the Parsi families residing in the locality.
Various offerings were made, the principal of which was a
black <i>murgha</i> or fowl, the common victim of such sacrifices.
It was believed that in the still hours of the night the
saint used to come out of the well and move about in the house.
His steps were heard distinctly on the staircase and his presence
was announced by the creaking sound that was heard
round about. But my friend, who used to burn midnight oil
in that house during his college days and who has since been
wedded to science, is inclined to think that the footsteps were
those of the rats infesting the house and that the creaking
sound was made by the wooden book-cases!</p>

<p>A Parsi lady who lived in the same house says that people
from various parts of the town used to take offerings to
the spirit of the well, amongst which were big <i>thalis</i> (trays)
of sweetmeat. Children were asked not to touch these, but this
young lady freely helped herself to those sweets. Another friend,
who took similar liberties with the offerings, was Mr. Jamsetji
Nadirshaw. He used to live in Mapla’s house in old Modikhana.
The well of this house was adored by people and young
Jamsetji pilfered a lot of sweets offered to the gods. Sir
Dinsha Edulji Wacha, who lived in the house during his childhood,
informs me that his mother and grand-mother used to
tell him many a thrilling story of the queer ways in which the
guardian spirit of the well used to divert them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>A friend living in Karwar Street (Modi Khana) says that the
well of his house is sacred to a Mahomedan <i>pir</i> and that to
this day vows are offered to the saint and his blessings sought
whenever the tenants are in difficulty. On the full moon day
the well is decorated with flowers and the saint is implored
to cure cases of illness which defy the doctor’s skill. Needless
to say, these offerings and prayers are speedily followed by the
recovery of the patients.</p>

<p>Another well in Parsi Bazar Street is also believed to harbour
a beneficent <i>pir</i>. Only four years ago, a friend was informed that
when doctors despaired of curing a patient, a Parsi carpenter
suggested that the well spirit should be implored to save the
patient. He brought certain people versed in the art of propitiating
spirits and asked them to try their skill. They
gratified the well-spirit by placing grain and other offerings on
the surface of the water and by remaining in the water for days
together, muttering incantations. The patient was thoroughly
cured and, no wonder, he attributes the cure to the grace of
the water saint.</p>

<p>These folk beliefs in the efficacy of well-water and the influence
of the spirits dwelling in it are, as already observed, in no
way peculiar to the City of Bombay or to other parts of the
country of India and present no new phase of human thought.
They are common to the whole world. In the concept of primeval
man everything had its spirit. Particularly did it associate life
with motion. The spring was ever flowing, ever bountiful,
ever refreshing and fertilizing and came to be regarded as a
living organism, a benevolent spirit supplying man with the
prime necessity of life and endowed with purifying and healing
qualities. Everywhere, therefore, the source of this quickening
element that had such charms came to be adored so that the
water-worship in the East has its striking counterpart in the
history of Western thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Robertson Smith identifies well-worship with the agricultural
life of aborigines who had not yet developed the idea
of a heavenly God. This is his description of the worship prevailing
in Arabia: “The fountain is treated as a living thing,
those properties of its waters which we call natural are regarded
as manifestations of a divine life, and the source itself is
honoured as a divine being, I had almost said a divine animal.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
“This pregnant summary of well-worship in Arabia,” says
Sir Laurence Gomme in his <i>Ethnology of Folklore</i>, “may,
without the alteration of a single word, be adopted as the summary
of well-worship in Britain and its isles.” One might
even say that well-worship is probably more widespread in the
West than in the East and that some of the rituals there
observed are more primitive than those which distinguish it in
the East.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MOST WIDE-SPREAD PHASE OF ANIMISM.</span></h3>

<p>We have seen that water-worship was a cult of hoary antiquity.
The belief that every locality has its presiding genius gave
rise to the deification of fountains and rivers just as it led to the
deification of hills and trees and other phases of animism. The
emphasis of animism lies in its localisation, in the local spirits
which, to quote Tylor’s words, belong to mountain and rock
and valley, to well and stream and lake, in brief, to those natural
objects which in early ages aroused the savage mind to mythological
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Some localities may not have in their midst such
weird places as mountains and rivers, groves and forests, but
scarcely any district is devoid of a well or a pool of water. Of
all nature-worship, therefore, well-worship is the most widespread.
Just the same scenes as one witnesses to-day at wells
and tanks in India were beheld for ages in other parts of the
world. Just the same stories as one hears to-day of the mysterious
ways and powers of water-spirits were everywhere heard
before. We have already seen that it was a general cult with
the ancient Iranians and with the help of Professor Robertson
Smith and Professor Curtiss we have also noticed how in
Arabia the fountain was treated as a living thing and the source
itself honoured as a divine being.</p>

<p>Max Müller, however, puts a different construction on the
deification of natural objects. He points out that it is in India
more than anywhere else that animism has been made to disclose
its secret cause, namely, the necessity of deriving all appellative
nouns from roots necessarily expressive, as Noire has shown,
of action, so that, whether we like it or not, the sun whether
called Svar or Vishnu, bull, swan or any other name, becomes <i>ipso
nomine</i> an agent, the shiner or the wanderer, the strong man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the swift bird. By the same process the wind is the blower, the
night the calmer, the moon, Soma, the rainer. What is classed as
animism in ancient Aryan mythology, he observes, is often no
more than a poetical conception of nature which enables the poets
to address the sun and moon, and rivers and trees as if they
could hear and understand his words. “Sometimes however,”
he continues, “what is called animism is a superstition which
after having recognised agents in sun and moon, rivers and trees,
postulates on the strength of analogy the existence of agents or
spirits dwelling in other parts of nature also, haunting our
houses, bringing misfortunes upon us, though sometimes conferring
blessings also.” It lies beyond the scope of this work
to enter into any discussion of this theory, but we shall see as we
proceed that the theory of poetic personification does not harmonize
with the myriad details of folklore of wells and springs.</p>

<p>One might be inclined to attribute the worship of water to
the great economic value which water possesses in the hot and
dry regions of the east where wells and springs are veritable
assets of the people, the most precious gifts of the gods. But it
was not in arid lands only that wells received divine honour.
There is ample evidence to show that people inhabiting lands
rich in springs and fountains also held them sacred and worshipped
the divine beings under whose protection the streams flowed
bubbling across their fields. It would seem, therefore, that the
spiritual element has been the uppermost in the worship of
water. It was in view of the religious awe in which the Greeks
held rivers that they raised their prayers to the springs, as may
be gathered from the prayers offered by Odysseus to the
river after his vicissitudes in the deep and from the description
given by Homer in the <i>Iliad</i> of the sacrifice offered at
flowing springs.</p>

<p>According to the Old Testament water was an important
factor during the first three days of Creation. On the first day
“the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters”; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
second day the nether waters were divided from the upper,
and the latter were transformed into the “rakia” or “firmament”;
and on the third day the nether waters were assigned
to their allotted place, which received the name of “sea.” The
Gnostics regarded water as the original element and through
their influence and the influence of the Greeks similar beliefs
gained currency among the Jews, so that Judah ben Pazi
transmitted the following saying in the name of R. Ismael:
“In the beginning the world consisted of water within water;
the water was then changed into ice and again transformed by
God into earth. The earth itself, however, rests upon the
waters, and the waters on the mountains” (<i>i.e.</i> the clouds).<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Nature withheld stone and wood from the Babylonian, but bestowed
upon him by way of compensation another invaluable gift—the
sea and the rivers. The Babylonian fully realized its value
as an incentive to civilization. In his work on the <i>Evolution of the
Aryan</i> Rudolph von Ibering points out that in his conception of
the God Nun the Babylonian personified the idea that water was
the source of all life, that historically the earth came forth from
the water as well as that water was the source of all blessing,
the quickening element of creation. Indeed, in Mesopotamia
more than anywhere else one could vividly realize the fact that
the inhabited soil had once formed the bottom of the sea and had
become dry land through the retreat of the waters. In Egypt
Shu, the air, rises from water which existed before the gods and
goddesses some of whom like Vishnu, Vira-Kocha and Aphrodite,
have actually sprung from waters. In the Quran Lord Almighty
says: “We clave the heavens and earth asunder, and by
means of water, we gave life to everything.” This is also one of
the Ebionite doctrines. The Akkad triad of gods was formed
of Ea, the ocean-god, who was also known as “the lord of the
earth” with Na, the Sky, and Mul-ge, the lord of the underworld.
They had no local water-deities, but from the earliest
times we come across two stages of development of one central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
idea—the conception of the natural element as an animated
being itself and the separation of its animating fetish-soul as a
distinct spiritual deity. In the <i>Land of the Hittites</i> Garstang
says that the Hittites seem to have absorbed into their pantheon
a number of acceptable nature-cults, like the worship of
mountains and streams and of the mother-goddess of earth,
already practised by an earlier population whom they overlaid.
In the history of Polybius is recorded an oath made by
Hannibal to Philip of Macedon containing two triads sacred
to the Phœnicians: “Sun, Moon and Earth”; “Rivers,
Meadows and Waters.”</p>

<p>In the Puranas the Vedic God Varuna is the “lord of the
waters.” He rides on the Makara, half crocodile, half fish,
rules the soft west winds and controls the salt seas and the
“seminal principle.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The noose of Varuna is called the Nâgapâsa,
or snake-noose, from which the wicked cannot escape.
Every twinkle of man’s eyes and his inward thoughts are known
to Varuna. “He sees as if he were always near: none can flee
from his presence, nor be rid of Varuna. If we flee beyond
the sky, he is there; he knows our uprising and lying down.”
Originally Mithra and Varuna were merely the names for day
and night and it is interesting to note how the conception of the
night served to convey the idea of the ocean. “The night,”
says Kunte,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> “presents the phenomenon of an expanse which
resembles that of the ocean in colour, in extent, in depth, and
in undulating motion. Hence the idea of the one naturally
expressed the idea of the other. The god of night became the
god of waters.” The same author thus sums up the different
stages of the development of the idea of Varuna:</p>

<p>1. Varuna, darkness or night and one possessed of meshes.</p>

<p>2. Varuna, ocean or firmament.</p>

<p>3. Varuna, lord of waters.</p>

<p>4. One who aided sailors, a beneficent god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to the classic world, we find that the early Greeks,
like the Babylonians, regarded the ocean as a broad river surrounding
the earth, the abode whence spirits came, and to which
they returned, and so a “river of life and death.” They called
Okeanos, the ocean, the son of heaven and earth, and his wife
was Tēthis, or Tēthus; together they were the parents of all
waters.</p>

<p>“To the great Olympian assembly in the halls of cloud-compelling
Zeus came the Rivers, all save Ocean, and thither
came the nymphs who dwell in lovely groves and at the springs
of streams, and in the grassy meads; and they sate upon the
polished seats. Even against Hephaistos, the Fire-god, a River-god
dared to stand opposed, deep-eddying Xanthos, called of
men Skamandros. He rushed down to overwhelm Achilles and
bury him in sand and slime, and though Hephaistos prevailed
against him with his flames, and forced him, with the fish
skurrying hither and thither in his boiling waves and the willows
scorched upon his banks, to rush on no more but stand,
yet at the word of white-armed Here, that it was not fit for
mortals’ sake to handle so roughly an immortal god, Hephaistos
quenched his furious fire, and the returning flood sped again
along his channel.”</p>

<p>Neptune was the Latin Sea-god, “the lord of dwelling waves.”
When Kleomenes marched down to Thyrea, having slaughtered
a bull to the sea, he embarked his army in ships for the Tirynthian
land and Nauplia. Cicero makes Cotta remark to Balbus
that “our generals, embarking on the sea, have been accustomed
to immolate a victim to the waves,” and he goes on to argue
that if the Earth herself is a goddess she is no other than Tellus
and if the earth, the sea too referred to by Balbus as Neptune.
Here, says Tylor<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, is direct nature-worship in its extremest sense
of fetish-worship. But in the anthropomorphic stage appear
that dim pre-Olympian figure of Nēreus, the Old Man of the Sea,
father of the Nereids in their ocean-caves, and the Homeric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Poseidon, the Earth-shaker, “who stables his coursers in his
cave in the Ægean deeps, who harnesses the gold-maned steeds
to his chariot and drives through the dividing waves, while the
subject sea-beasts come up at the passing of their lord, a king so
little bound to the element he governs, that he can come from
the brine to sit in the midst of the gods in the assembly on Olympos,
and ask the will of Zeus.”</p>

<p>The third greatest god of the Scandinavians was Niörd, born
in Vanaheim (the water home), and living among sailors in Noatun
(ship town) ruling the winds, and sea, and quenching the fires
of day in his waves. To the Vanir, or sea folk, he was the
“rich and beneficent one,” and his children were Frey and
Freya. Skadi, “the scathing one”, daughter of Thiassi the
giant god of land, took him as her husband, but land and water
did not long agree. His consort is also Nerthus, the earth-goddess
of Rugen, called by the Germans, the iron lady.</p>

<p>Japan deifies separately on land and at sea the lords of the
waters. Midsuno Kami, the water-god, is worshipped during
the rainy season and Jebisu, the sea-god, is younger brother of
the Sun to whom the Japanese offer cloth, rice and bottles of
rum, just as the Greek sacrificed a bull to Poseidon and the
Romans to Neptune, before a voyage. The Peruvian sea-god
Virakocha, “foam of the lake” or “of the waters,” was often
identified with the Creator. Arising from the waters he made
the sun and the planets, gave life to stones and created all
things.</p>

<p>“It appears from Bosman’s account, about 1700,” says Tylor,
“that in the religion of Whydah, the sea ranked only as younger
brother in the three divine orders, below the serpents and trees.
But at present, as appears from Captain Burton’s evidence, the
religion of Whydah extends through Dahowe, and the Divine
Sea has risen in rank. The youngest brother of the triad is
Hu, the ocean or sea. Formerly, it was subject to chastisement,
like the Hellespont, if idle or useless. The Huno, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ocean priest, is now considered the highest of all, a fetish king,
at Whydah, where he has 500 wives. At stated times he repairs
to the beach, begs ‘Agbwe’, the ocean-god, not to be
boisterous, and throws in rice and corn, oil and beans, cloth,
cowries and other valuables. At times the King sends as an
ocean sacrifice from Agbowe a man carried in a hammock, with
the dress, the stool, and the umbrella of a caboceer; a canoe
takes him out to sea, where he is thrown to the sharks. While
in these descriptions the individual divine personality of the sea
is so well marked, an account of the closely related slave coast
religion states that a great god dwells in the sea, and it is to
him, not to the sea itself, that offerings are cast in. In South
America the idea of the divine sea is clearly marked in the
Peruvian worship of Mamacocha, Mother Sea, giver of food to
men.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The Egyptians gratefully recognize how much they owe to
the Nile and in their hymns they thank the Nile-god. Statues
of the god are painted green and red, representing the colour of
the river in June when it is a bright green before the inundation
and the ruddy hue when its wells are charged with the red mud
brought down from the Abyssinian mountains. We have already
noticed that the spring was and is still adored as Lord Almighty’s
daughter by the Zoroastrians. The Zoroastrian scriptures
record how she was worshipped by the Heavenly Father Himself
when He wanted her assistance in inducing <i>Zarathushtra</i> to
become His prophet. Even to this day a festival is held in her
honour by the Parsis in Bombay on the tenth day of the eighth
month of the Parsi year. This day as well as the month bear
the name Aban. The Parsis flock in numbers on this auspicious
day to the sea-beach to offer prayers.</p>

<p>Not unlike the Iranians the Greeks also adored their marine
goddess Aphrodite, “born in the foam of the sea.” Greek
folklore tells us how this goddess rose from the sea opposite the
island of Cythera. She was also the goddess of love and was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
earlier times regarded as the goddess of domestic life and of the
relations between families, being in some places associated with
Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, or regarded, like Artemis,
as a guardian of children and young maidens. Odysseus invoked
the river of Scheria, Skamandros had his priest and Spercheios
his grove, and sacrifice was given to the river-god Acheloos,
eldest of the three thousand river-children, and old Okeanos.</p>

<p>Greek saints were believed to bestow wells of water endowed
with miraculous properties, and frequently on their feast days
an extra supply made the wells overflow. The monastery of
Plemmyri, in the south-east of Rhodes, possesses a well of this
nature. The priest walks round it, offering up certain prayers
and sometimes the water rises in answer to his invocation and
flows over into the Court. Another such interesting well exists
in the Church of the Virgin at Balukli, outside the walls of
Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the Romans had their water-nymph Egeria. Women
with child used to offer sacrifices to her, because she was believed
to be able, like <i>Ardevi Sur Anahita</i> and Diana, to grant
them an easy delivery. Every day Roman Vestals fetched
water from her spring to wash the temple of Vesta, carrying it
in earthenware pitchers on their heads. In his Golden Bough
Sir James Frazer observes that the remains of baths which
were discovered near that site together with many terra cotta
models of various parts of the human body suggest that the
waters of Egeria were used to heal the sick who may have
signified their hopes or testified their gratitude by dedicating
likenesses of the diseased members to the goddess, in accordance
with a custom which is still observed in many parts of Europe.
Examples of the survival of this custom in modern times are
given by Blunt in his <i>Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs
in Modern Italy and Sicily</i>. It is also widespread among the
Catholic population in Southern Germany and the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
missionaries from those parts have brought the custom to India
also. Almost every Sunday the Goans and Native Christians of
Bombay, for instance, will be seen dedicating likenesses of
diseased limbs made of wax to Virgin Mary at Mount Mary’s
chapel at Bandra in gratitude for the cures effected through
her grace. The custom has spread amongst other communities
and I have heard of several cases in which Parsi ladies have
taken such offerings to the Chapel.</p>

<p>This parallelism of beliefs and catholicity of cures remind
one of the faith which not only the Greeks and the Roman
Catholics, but the Turks and the Jews had in the miracles
wrought by the Greek Saints. The best known instance of this,
given by Miss Hamilton in her illuminating work on <i>Greek
Saints and their Festivals</i>, is the large marble fountain standing
in the court of the Panagia’s Church at Tenos. It was the gift
of a grateful Turk cured, according to his own conviction, by the
Panagia of the Christians. To a certain extent a feeling was
prevalent against permitting unbelievers to participate in these
boons, but it was futile in effect and the cures of infidels
continued. Within the Smyrna Cathedral there is a holy
well the water of which is specially renowned for the cure
of ophthalmia. Turks, along with Greeks, shared in its
benefits to an extent which excited the jealousy of the officials
and they resolved to give ordinary water in response to the
demands of infidels. This stratagem was, however, ineffectual
for the eyes of the Turks were cured nevertheless with the
unsanctified medium just as thoroughly as with the holy water.
This might have shaken the faith of the believers in the holy
well, but fortunately for them no such rude awakening appears
to have marred their confidence in the miraculous powers of
the well or of the saints.</p>

<p>Numerous proofs of water-worship in Great Britain exist
to-day. English folklore is full of these and we shall notice
them presently. There is also archæological evidence establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the prevalence of the cult. On a pavement at Sydney
Park, Gloucestershire, on the western bank of the Severn, has
been carved the figure of one of the English river divinities.
The principal figure is a youthful deity crowned with rays like
Phoebus and standing in a chariot drawn, as in the case of <i>Banu
Ardevi Sur Anahita</i> of the Iranians, by four horses. Three inscriptions
are preserved: (1) Devo Nodenti; (2) D. M. Nodonti
and (3) Deo Nudente M. The form Nodens has been identified
by Professor Rhys with the Welsh Lludd and with the Irish
Nuada. This monumental relic by no means presents the
British embodiment of the water-god, the work being Roman
it evidently bears the stamp of the Roman interpretation of
the British belief in the local god and has been modelled on
the Roman standard of the water-god Neptune. The whole
find has been fully described and illustrated in a special volume
by the Rev. W. H. Bathurst and C. W. King.</p>

<p>In Tylor’s <i>Primitive Culture</i> we find the following American
examples of animistic ideas concerning water. “Who makes
this river flow?” asks the Algonquin hunter in a medicine
song, and his answer is, “The spirit, he makes this river flow.”
In any great river, or lake, or cascade, there dwell such spirits,
looked upon as mighty manitus. Thus Carver mentions the
habit of the Red Indians, when they reached the shores of
Lake Superior or the banks of the Mississippi, or any great body
of water, to present to the spirit who resides there some kind
of offering; this he saw done by a Winnebago chief who went
with him to the Falls of St. Anthony. Franklin saw a similar
sacrifice made by an Indian, whose wife had been afflicted with
sickness by the water-spirits and who accordingly to appease
them tied up in a small bundle a knife and a piece of tobacco
and some other trifling articles, and committed them to the
rapids. On the river-bank the Peruvians would scoop up a
handful of water and drink it, praying the river deity to let
them cross or to give them some fish, and they threw maize
into the stream as a propitiating offering. Even to this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the Indians of the Cordilleras perform the ceremonial sip before
they will pass a river on foot or horseback, just as the Hindus
and Parsis throw cocoanuts and flowers and sugar.</p>

<p>Tylor also gives the following African rites of water-worship.
In the East, among the Wanika, every spring has its spirit, to
which oblations are made. In the West, in the Akra district,
lakes, ponds and rivers received worship as local deities. In
the South, among the Kafirs, streams are venerated as personal
beings, or the abodes of personal deities, as when a man crossing
a river will ask leave of its spirit, or having crossed will throw
in a stone; or when the dwellers by a stream will sacrifice a
beast to it in time of drought, or, warned by illness in the tribe
that their river is angry, will cast into it a few handfuls of millet
or the entrails of a slaughtered ox. Not less strongly marked,
says Tylor, are such ideas among the Tartar races of the north.
Thus the Ostyaks venerate the river Ob, and when fish is scanty
will hang a stone about a rein-deer’s neck and cast it in for a
sacrifice. Among the Buræts, who are professing Buddhists,
the old worship may still be seen at the picturesque little mountain
lake of Ikeougoun, where they come to the wooden temple
on the shore to offer sacrifices of milk and butter and the fat of
the animals which they burn on the altars.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to overlay this chapter with countless
other European and Indian examples. We shall examine these
more fully in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<span class="smaller">CHRISTIAN TOLERANCE OF THE CULT OF WATER.</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the West the cult of water was flourishing along
with the cult of trees and stones when Christianity found its
way to Europe. The holy wells which were then plentiful
have since changed their names, but a few have still retained
their old names. Thus there is or was a spring called Woden’s
well in Gloucestershire, which supplies water to the moat
around Wandswell Court, also a Thor’s Well, or Thorskill, in
Yorkshire. When the faith and usages of the Celtics and the
Anglo-Saxons came in contact with Christianity, together with
the still older faiths and customs which the Celt and Teuton
had continued or allowed to continue, the new religion did not
distinguish between the various shades of beliefs and usages.
It merely treated all alike as pagan. Kings, Popes and Church
Councils issued edict after edict condemning non-Christian
practices. Let us cite some of these. The second Council of
Arles, held about the year 452, issued the following canon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If in the territory of a bishop infidels light torches or
venerate trees, fountains, or stones, and he neglects to abolish
this usage, he must know that he is guilty of sacrilege.”</p>

</div>

<p>King Canute in England and Charlemagne in Europe also
conducted vigorous campaigns against these relics of paganism.
Here is an extract from Charlemagne’s edict:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With respect to trees, stones, and fountains, where certain
foolish people light torches or practise other superstitions, we
earnestly ordain that the most evil custom detestable to God,
wherever it be found, should be removed and destroyed.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>It was too much, however, to hope for the total eradication
of those faiths and customs of age-long existence. Pope Gregory
was not slow to realize this, as will be seen from the following
extract from his famous letter to the Abbot Mellitus in the
year 601:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When, therefore, Almighty God shall bring you to
the most reverend Bishop Augustine our Brother, tell
him what I have, upon mature deliberation on the affair
of the English, determined upon, namely that the
temples of the idols (<i>fana idolorum</i>) in that nation
(<i>gente</i>) ought not to be destroyed; but let the idols that
are in them be destroyed; let holy water be made and
sprinkled upon the said temples, let altars be erected
and relics placed. For if these temples be well built,
it is requisite that they may be converted from the
worship of devils (<i>dæmonum</i>) to the worship of the
true God; that the nation seeing that their temples
are not destroyed may remove error from their hearts,
and knowing and adoring the true God may the more
familiarly resort to the places to which they have been
accustomed. And because they have been used to
slaughter many oxen in the sacrifices to devils some
solemnity must be exchanged for them on this account,
so that on the day of the dedication, or the nativities
of the holy martyrs whose relics are there deposited,
they may build themselves huts of the boughs of trees
about those churches which have been turned to that
use from temples and celebrate the solemnity with religious
feasting and no more offer beasts to the devil
(<i>diabolo</i>), but kill cattle to the praise of God in their
eating, and return thanks to the giver of all things for
their sustenance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus did the early Christian missionaries come to regard
the old phase of water-worship tenderly. Adopting what they
could not abolish, they blessed the waters of holy wells and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
used them for baptism of converts and erected chapels or oratories
near by or placed an image of the Virgin, or some saint,
near sacred trees and rivers or over holy wells and fountains.
Thus did the new faith which aimed in principle at the purity
of Christian doctrine permit in practice a continuance of pagan
worship under Christian auspices. Curious was the result.
Under the transformation of beliefs thus unconsciously
wrought the simple-hearted Christians beheld in brilliant
images of the virgin and the saints fresh dwelling-places for
the presiding deities of the waters whom they and their
forefathers had venerated in the past. The belief in the miraculous
power of water became linked with the name of <i>Madonna</i>
or some saintly messenger of God and so enduring was this
combination that it gave a new lease of life to the old beliefs.</p>

<p>One by one the old ideas and customs which were firmly rooted
in the multitude came to be absorbed into Christianity. A dual
system of belief thus sprang up and this is very strikingly reflected
in the supplication of an old Scottish peasant when he went
to worship at a sacred well:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O Lord, Thou knowest that well would it be for me
this day an I had stoopit my knees and my heart
before Thee in spirit and in truth as often as I have
stoopit them after this well. But we maun keep the
customs of our fathers.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What is true of well-worship is true of other phases of nature-worship.
A vivid picture of the result of the Christian tolerance
of paganism has been drawn by Grimm in the preface to the
second edition of his Teutonic Mythology. For our present
purpose it will suffice to quote from it only two or three sentences
which have a direct bearing on the question of water-worship:
“Sacred wells and fountains,” says he, “were rechristened after
saints, to whom their sanctity was transferred. Law usages,
particularly the ordeals and oath-takings, but also the beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of bounds, consecrations, image processions, spells and formula,
while retaining their heathen character, were simply clothed in
Christian forms. In some customs there was little to change:
the heathen practice of sprinkling a new-born babe with water
closely resembled Christian baptism.”</p>

<p>This reference to adapted pagan rites in connection with the
baptismal ceremony recalls the words in which Mr. Edward Clodd
in <i>Tom Tit Tot</i> traces the early beginnings of the order of the
Christian clergy to a prehistoric past. “The priest who christens
the child in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,”
says he, “is the lineal descendant, the true apostolic successor
of the medicine-man. He may deny the spiritual father who
begot him, and vaunt his descent from St. Peter. But the first
Bishop of Rome, granting that title to the apostle, was himself
a parvenu compared to the barbaric priest who uttered his
incantations on the hill now crowned by the Vatican.”</p>

<p>“We think with sympathy,” continues Mr. Clodd, “of that
‘divine honour’ which Gildas tells us our forefathers paid to
wells and streams; of the food-bringing rivers which, in the old
Celtic faith, were ‘mothers’; of the eddy in which the water-demon
lurked; of the lakes ruled by lovely queens; of the
nymphs who were the presiding genii of wells.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOLY WELLS AND TANKS.</span></h3>

<p>With the learned author of <i>Tom Tit Tot</i> we also think with
sympathy of the worship of the saint Khwaja Khizr, who is
believed by the Syrians to have caused water to flow in the
Sabbati fountain in northern Syria and who is ranked among
the prophets by the Mahomedans and recognised by the Hindus
as a patron saint of boatmen, his Moslem name being Hinduised
into Râjâ Kidar or Kawaj or Pir Badra. He is, however,
most widely known as the patron saint of the water of
immortality. When the great Sikandar, Alexander of Macedon,
went in quest of the blessed waters, Khizr accompanied him,
as a guide, to Zulmat, the region of darkness, where the spring
of the water of immortality was believed to exist. When they
reached Zulmat, Khizr said that only 12 persons should enter
that region on 12 mares and that each mare’s colt should be
tied outside so that should any one lose his way, the mare
on which he rode might lead him back to the starting point,
following the direction from which she would hear the neighing
of her colt. This course was followed. According to one
account, the party succeeded in reaching the coveted spring.
Khizr drank from it first and then asked Sikandar to drink
as much as he liked. The conqueror of the East, however,
stood still. He saw before him some very aged birds in a
pitiable condition, longing for death and muttering <i>maut, maut,
maut</i>, death, death, death! Death, however, would not come
to them as they had tasted the water of immortality.
This was enough to unnerve Alexander and he turned
back without tasting the water. According to another
tradition, Khizr slipped away in the region of darkness,
went alone to the spring and drank from it. Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and his comrades lost their way and were only able to
emerge from the darkness with the help of their mares who
instinctively followed the direction whence they heard the
neighing of their colts.</p>

<p>In India the fish is believed to be the vehicle of Khwaja
Khizr. Its image is therefore painted over the doors of Hindus
and Mahomedans in Northern India and it became the family
crest of one of the royal families of Oudh. When a Mahomedan
lad is shaved for the first time, a prayer is offered to the saint
and a little boat is launched in his honour in a tank or river.
The Hindus as well as the Mahomedans in Upper India
invoke his help when their boats go adrift and they worship
him by burning lamps and by setting afloat on a village pond
a little raft of grass with a lighted lamp placed upon it. A
Mahomedan friend who has often taken part in this ceremony
which is known as <i>Khwaja Saheb ka Dalya</i>, has favoured me
with the following description of it: “On the evening of the
ceremony people congregate by the side of the river and bring
with them a quantity of <i>dalya</i>, a confection of wheat, and a
tiny boat prepared for the occasion. They then light a <i>diva</i>
or ghee lamp, and place it by the side of the <i>dalya</i>, which is
then consecrated in the name of Khwaja Khizr by reading
<i>Fatiha</i> over it. A portion of the confection is then placed in
the boat which is launched in the river with the small lamp
in it. The remaining portion is distributed amongst friends
and relations and the poor.”</p>

<p>As a rule the Mahomedans do not worship water. They,
however, hold the well Zumzum in Mecca in great veneration.
It is believed that this single well supplies water to the whole
city and that its water comes up bubbling on occasions of
religious fervour. The water of the well is also credited with
miraculous properties and on their return from the pilgrimage
to the holy city almost all the Hajis (pilgrims) bring home the
water of Zumzum in small tins and distribute it amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
friends who use it as a cure for several diseases and also
sprinkle it on the sheet covering the dead.</p>

<p>No other holy well attracts the followers of Islam, but for
the Hindus the number of such places of pilgrimage is
legion. Particularly do they flock in numbers to the sacred
rivers which are regarded as the dwelling places of some of the
most benevolent deities. In Northern India the Ganges
and the Jumna are known as “Ganga Mâi”, or Mother
Ganges, and “Jumnaji” or Lady Jumna. Foremost
in the rank of the holy rivers is the Ganges, which, like
other rivers, is specially sacred at certain auspicious
conjunctions of the planets when crowds of people are seen
bathing on her banks. This sanctity is shared by several towns
along the shores of the river such as Hardwar, Bithur, Allahabad,
Benares and Ganga Sagar. No less sacred is the Godavari,
believed to be the site of the hermitage of Gautama. When the
planet <i>Brihaspati</i> (Jupiter) enters the <i>Sinha Rashi</i> (the constellation
of Leo), a phenomenon which takes place once in twelve
years, the holy Ganges goes to the Godavari and remains there
for one year and during that year all the gods bathe in this
river. Hence the pilgrimage of thousands of Hindus to Nasik
to offer prayers to the Godavari. A pilgrimage similar to this is
common in Russia. There, an annual ceremony of blessing the
waters of the Neva is usually performed in the presence of the
Czar.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Multitudes flock to the site and struggle for some of
the newly blessed water with which they cross themselves and
sprinkle their clothes.</p>

<p>In his “Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India”
Crooke observes that many of the holy wells in Northern India
are connected with the wanderings of Rama and Sita after
their exile from Ayodhya. Sita’s kitchen (<i>Sita ki rasoi</i>) is shown
in various places, as at Kanauj and Deoriya in the Allahabad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
District. Her well is on the Bindhachal hill in Mirzapur, and
is a famous resort of pilgrims. There is another near Monghyr
and a third in the Sultanpur District in Oudh. The Monghyr
well has been invested with a special legend. Sita was suspected
of faithlessness during her captivity in the kingdom of Ravana.
She threw herself into a pit filled with fire, where the hot spring
now flows, and came out purified. When Dr. Buchanan visited
the place, he heard a new story in connection with it. Shortly
before, it was said, the water became so cool as to allow bathing
in it. The Governor prohibited the practice as it made the
water so dirty that Europeans could not drink it. “But on
the very day when the bricklayers began to build a wall in order
to exclude the bathers, the water became so hot that no one
could dare to touch it, so that the precaution being unnecessary,
the work of the infidels was abandoned.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>A bath in the waters of wells is believed to have the same
efficacy for expiating sin as a bath in the holy rivers. This belief
rests on the theory that springs and rivers flow under the agency
of an indwelling spirit which is generally benignant and that
bathing brings the sinner into communion with the spirit and
purifies him in the moral more than in the physical sense. It
is believed that even the dead are benefited by such ceremonies.</p>

<p>A very typical case of the efficacy of such religious baths
is that of King Trisanku, who had committed three deadly
sins. According to one story he tried to win his way to heaven
by a great sacrifice which his priest, Vashishtha, declined to
perform. According to another account he ran away with the
wife of a citizen, and killed in a time of famine the wondrous
cow of Vashishtha. Another story accused him of having
married his step-mother. After he had been sufficiently chastised,
the saint Viswamitra took pity on him and having collected
water from all the sacred places in the world, washed him clean
of all offences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brahmins also wash themselves of sins with the washing
of their sacred thread every year, with a ceremony of sprinkling of
water and cow’s urine. This ceremony is known as Shrávani
amongst the Marathas and Mārjan Vidhi amongst the Gujeratis.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate the numerous sacred
wells of India. A few instances may, however, be cited from
the <i>Folklore Notes of Gujarat</i>.</p>

<p>Six miles to the east of Dwarka there is a <i>kund</i> called Pind
tarak, where many persons go to perform the <i>Shrâddha</i> and the
<i>Nârâyan-bali</i> ceremonies. They first bathe in the <i>kund</i>; then,
with its water, they prepare pindas, and place them in a metal
dish; red lac is applied to the pindas, and a piece of cotton
thread wound round them; the metal dish being then dipped in
the <i>kund</i>, when the <i>pindas</i>, instead of sinking, are said to
remain floating on the water. The process is believed to earn a
good status for the spirits of departed ancestors in heaven. It
is further said that physical ailments brought on by the <i>avagati</i>,
degradation or fallen condition, of ancestors in the other world,
are remedied by the performance of <i>Shrâddha</i> on this <i>kund</i>.</p>

<p>The Damodar <i>kund</i> is situated near Junagadh. It is said that
if the bones of a deceased person remaining unburnt after
cremation are dipped in this <i>kund</i>, his soul obtains <i>moksha</i>
or final emancipation.</p>

<p>There is a <i>vav</i> or reservoir on Mount Girnar, known as Rasakupika-vav.
It is believed that the body of a person bathing
in it becomes as hard as marble, and that if a piece of stone or
iron is dipped in the <i>vav</i>, it is instantly transformed into gold.
But the <i>vav</i> is only visible to saints and sages who are gifted
with a supernatural vision.</p>

<p>Kashipuri (Benares) contains a <i>vav</i> called Gnyan-vav, in
which there is an image of Vishweshwar (the Lord of the Universe,
<i>i.e.</i>, Shiva). A bath in the water from this <i>vav</i> is
believed to confer upon a person the gift of divine knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>In the village of Chunval, a few miles to the north of Viramgam,
there is a <i>kund</i> known as Loteshwar, near which stands
a pipal tree. Persons possessed by ghosts or devils are freed
from possession by pouring water at the foot of the tree and
taking turns round it, remaining silent the while.</p>

<p>There is a <i>kund</i> called Zelāka near Zinzuvadá with a temple
of Naleshwar Māhadev near it. The <i>kund</i> is said to have been
built at the time of King Nala. It is believed locally that every
year, on the 15th day of the bright half of Bhādrapad, the holy
Ganges visits the <i>kund</i> by an underground route. A great
fair is held there on that day, when people bathe in the <i>kund</i>
and give alms to the poor. There is also another <i>kund</i> close
by, known as Bholava, where the river Saraswati is believed to
have halted and manifested herself on her way to the sea.</p>

<p>In Bhadakon near Chuda there is a <i>kund</i> called Garigavo.
The place is celebrated as the spot of the hermitage of the sage
Bhrigu and a fair is held there annually on the last day of
<i>Bhādrapad</i>.</p>

<p>Persons anxious to attain heaven bathe in the Mrigi <i>kund</i>
on Mount Girnar; and a bath in the Revati <i>kund</i>, which is in
the same place, confers male issue on the bather. There is also
a <i>kund</i> of the shape of an elephant’s footprint <i>Pagahein</i> on
Mount Girnar. It never empties and is held most sacred by
pilgrims. People bathe in the Gomati <i>kund</i> near Dwarka and
take a little of the earth from its bed for the purification of their
souls. In the village of Babera, Babhruvāhan the son of
Arjun is said to have constructed several <i>kunds</i>, all of which
are believed to be holy.</p>

<p>A man is said to be released from re-birth if he takes a bath
in the <i>kund</i> named Katkale-tirtha near Nasik.</p>

<p>A pond near Khapoli in the Kolaba district is held very
sacred. The following story is related in connection with it.
The villagers say that the water nymphs in the pond used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
provide pots for marriage festivities if a written application
was made to them a day previous to the wedding. The pots
were, however, required to be returned within a limited time.
Once a man failed to comply with this condition and the nymphs
have ceased to lend pots.</p>

<p>The nymphs of a pond at Varsai in the Kolaba district were
also believed to lend pots on festive occasions. Persons held
unclean, <i>e.g.</i>, women in their menstrual period, are not allowed to
touch it. Similarly, a pool at Pushkar in Northern India turns
red if the shadow of a woman during the period falls upon it.</p>

<p>There are seven sacred ponds at Nirmal in the Thana
district, forming a large lake. These ponds are said to have
been formed from the blood of the demon Vimalsur.</p>

<p>There are sacred pools of hot water in the Vaitarna river
in the Thana district, in which people bathe on the 13th day
of the dark half of <i>chaitra</i>.</p>

<p>At Shahapur there is a holy spring of hot water under a
<i>pipal</i> tree, called Ganga.</p>

<p>It is held holy to bathe in the <i>kunds</i> that are situated
in the rivers Jansa and Banganga.</p>

<p>The Manikarnika well at Benares was produced by an
ear-ring of Shiva falling into it. If one drinks its water, it brings
wisdom. The water of the Jânavâpi well in Benares also
possesses the same property.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>At Sarkuhiya in the Basti district there is a well where
Buddha struck the ground with his arrow and brought forth
water just as Moses did from the rock.</p>

<p>Crooke says that he was shown a well in the Muzaffarnagar
district into which a Faqir once spat, which for a long time after
the visit of the holy man ran with excellent milk. The supply
had, however, ceased before the visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>A bath in the Man-sarovar near Bahucharaji is said to cause
the wishes of the bather to be fulfilled. There is a local
tradition that a Rajput woman was turned into a male
Rajput of the Solanki class by a bath in its waters.</p>

<p>The cult of the bath for the purification of the soul is not confined
to India and the Indian people. It was also widespread
amongst the European people and prevails even to-day on the
Continent. We have already seen that water-worship flourished
in Europe before the advent of Christianity and that the new faith
though antagonistic to it in principle was considerably tolerant in
practice. It is not surprising, therefore, that the old practice
should, with a varnish of Christianity, survive up to the present
day. In an article contributed not long ago to the <i>Good Words</i>
magazine, Mr. Colin Bennett observed: “Of all the remnants
of ancient pagan worship that which is dying hardest, or more
probably has not started to die at all, is the veneration of holy
wells and belief in their miraculous properties.”</p>

<p>In the year 1893 was published <i>The Legendary Lore of the
Holy Wells of England</i>, including Rivers, Lakes, Fountains
and Springs, by R. C. Hope. Unfortunately, I have not been
able to obtain a copy of this book, but from the reviews of
the work that appeared in the <i>Academy</i> and in the <i>Athenæum</i>
in August 1893, one gathers that although confessedly imperfect
Mr. Hope’s catalogue gives 129 names of saints in whose
honour English wells have been dedicated. The reviewers give
additional instances and point out that if inquiries were made,
many more such wells would be discovered. From the list
it appears that with the exception of Virgin Mary, who has
29 wells, and all Saints to whom 33 wells are dedicated, wells
under the patronage of St. Helen are the most numerous.
St. Helen was very popular in England, partly as being the
mother of Constantine, the First Christian Emperor, and partly
because two English cities, York and Colchester, claimed
her as a native. The reviewer of Mr. Hope’s work in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<i>Athenæum</i> suggested a third reason also for her popularity. She
discovered what was reputed to be the holy cross, hence in many
parts of England May 3rd, the festival of “The Invention of
the Cross”, was called “St. Helen’s Day in Spring”, and became
an important day in village affairs. Menor court rolls bear
witness, says the writer, that on that day commons were thrown
open for the pasturage of cattle, and occupiers of land adjoining
rivers well knew that it was the last day for repairing
their banks.</p>

<p>An interesting chapter on Holy Wells is also given in
<i>Knowlson’s Origins of Popular Superstitions</i>. On a little
island near the centre of Lough Fine there used to be a place
for pilgrims anxious to get rid of their sins, the journey
over the water being an important part of the business. In
Scotland (Tullie Beltane) there is a Druid temple of eight
up-right stones. Some distance away is another temple, and
near it a well still held in great veneration, says a writer in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine (1811)</i>. “On Beltane morning superstitious
people go to this well and drink of it; then they make
a procession round it nine times; after this they in like manner
go round the temple. So deep-rooted is this heathenish superstition
in the minds of many who reckon themselves good
Protestants, that they will not neglect these rites even when
Beltane falls on a Sabbath.”</p>

<p>Thomas Quiller-Couch took a deep interest in the holy wells
of Cornwall. He visited many of them and the notes taken
by him he intended to weave into a volume illustrative of
their history and the superstitions which had gathered around
them. Unfortunately the intention could not be carried out
during his lifetime, but with the help of these notes a volume
was subsequently published on the <i>Ancient and Holy Wells of
Cornwall</i> by M. and L. Quiller-Couch. This volume is not
obtainable in Bombay and in this case also I owe my information
concerning the work to the review which appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<i>Athenæum</i> of 10th August 1895. During a pilgrimage of several
months’ duration the joint authors were able to discover more
than ninety of such wells. From the account given by the
authors it would seem that the Cornish wells are rarely haunted
by spirits of any kind. They are holy, and cure all kinds of
sickness, madness included. They also tell us of the future,
provided proper rites are observed, and we may secure good
fortune by dropping a pin or a small coin into the water.</p>

<p>Major-General Forlong cites St. Peter’s well at Houston in
Renfrewshire, St. Ninian’s well at Stirling with its vaulted
cell, St. Catherine’s well at Liberton, St. Michael’s well near
the Linlithgow cathedral, and the well of Loch <i>Maree</i> as
some of the examples. Another sacred well is St. Mungo’s
over which the Glasgow cathedral stands. In Ireland “we
everywhere find peasants kneeling at sacred wells.” Of the
well of St. Margaret under the black precipitous cliffs of
Edinburgh Castle Major-General Forlong says that it is exactly
such a spot as he had seen in Central India, “where pious
persons precipitated themselves from the rock to please Siva
or Kali.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">HEALING WATERS.</span></h3>

<p>Many of these wells are renowned no less for their medicinal
properties than for their sanctity. Their waters are believed
to be under the care of sanitary guardians and are held to be
extremely efficacious in curing many a distemper.</p>

<p>The use of water for therapeutic purposes is mentioned in
the Old Testament, where it is stated that Naaman, who suffered
from skin disease, dipped himself seven times in the Jordan and
was cured. The New Testament records a case of congenital
blindness cured by washing in the River Siloa. Balneotherapy
and Hydrotherapy were not unknown in Talmudic times. The
Talmud mentions a special season between Easter and Whitsun
during which people used to go to the spas to take the waters or
mudbaths. The cure lasted twenty-one days. In the Temple a
special doctor was appointed to attend the priests for intestinal
trouble caused by their excessive eating of the flesh of sacrifices
and the treatment prescribed for them was the drinking of the
water of Siloa.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In Bombay the Manmala tank at Matunga, the major
portion of which has been recently filled up and on which
the Sassoon Reformatory now stands, has a reputation for
curing measles. People from distant parts bring their
children to this tank and the nymphs residing in it seldom
fail to cure them of the malady. We are not aware of any
other city well or tank gifted with such healing powers, but
there are several in the Bombay Presidency. The Folklore
notes of Gujarat mention a few. The water of the Krukalas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
well in the island of Shankhodwar is believed to cure fever
and diseases caused by morbid heat. A draught of the
water of the Gomukhi-Ganga, near Girnar, gives one absolute
immunity from an attack of cholera. The water of a gozara well
(<i>i.e.</i>, a well which is polluted owing to a person drowned in it)
cures children of bronchitis and cough. There is a well near
Ramdorana, of which the water is effective against cough, and
the water of the Bahamania well near Vasawad is credited with
the same virtue. The water of the Mrigi Kund near Junagadh
cures leprosy. The Pipli well near Talawad is well-known
for the stimulating effect of its water on the digestive organs.
The residents of Bombay, however, need not go to Talawad
for this boon. There are in the city the Bhikha Behram
well on Churchgate Street and the High Court well on Mayo
Road renowned for similar properties of their water. In Northern
India hydrophobia is believed to be cured if the patient
looks down seven wells in succession, while in Gujarat when a
person is bitten by a rabid dog, he goes to a well inhabited by
a <i>Vâchharo</i>, the spirit who curses hydrophobia, with two earthen
cups filled with milk with a pice in each, and empties the contents
into the water. In the island of Shiel there is a <i>vav</i> called <i>Than-vav</i>
where mothers who cannot suckle their children for want of
milk wash their bodices which, when subsequently put on,
are believed to cause the necessary secretion of milk.</p>

<p>It was recently brought to my notice that the guardian spirit
of a well in Lonavla also possessed the gift of blessing mothers
with milk. After that well had been dug, a goat was offered by
the owner of the well to the spirit. This offering proved most
unacceptable and the waters of the well at once dried up. The
owner implored pardon and vowed that no animal sacrifice
would ever again be offered, and that milk and ghee would
be presented instead. This had the desired effect and the
guardian spirit of the water has since been most friendly.
“A few months ago,” said my informant, “a young lady was
desirous of getting milk for her new-born babe. After fruitless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
attempts for a fortnight, she took an oath that she would
present to the water-saint <i>ghadas</i> of milk and ghee and she
was forthwith blest with milk for the infant.”</p>

<p>In the Konkan the water of a well drawn without touching
the earth or without being placed upon the ground is given as
medicine for indigestion.</p>

<p>There are ponds at Manora in the Goa State and Vetore in the
Savantwadi State, the water of which is used for the cure of persons
suffering from the poison of snakes, mice, spiders and scorpions.</p>

<p>If a person is bitten by a snake or other poisonous reptile,
no medicine is administered to him, but holy water brought
from the temple of the village goddess is given to him to drink
and it is said that the patient is cured.</p>

<p>At Shivam in the Ratnagiri district people use the <i>tirtha</i> of a
deity, or the water in which its idol is washed, as medicine for
diseases due to poison. It is the sole remedy they resort to
in such cases.</p>

<p>The water of seven tanks, or at least of one pond, in which
lotuses grow, is said to check the virulence of measles and smallpox.</p>

<p>A bath in a tank in the Mahim district is said to cure
persons suffering from skin diseases.</p>

<p>The well at Sihor in Rajputana is sacred to Gautama and
is considered efficacious in the cure of various disorders.</p>

<p>In Satara King Sateshwar asked the saint Sumitra for water.
The sage was wrapped in contemplation, and did not answer him.
The angry monarch took some lice from the ground and threw
them at the saint, who cursed the king with vermin all over his
body. This affliction the wretched monarch endured for twelve
years, until he was cured by ablution at the sacred fountain of
Devarâshta.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The birth of a child under the <i>mul nakshatra</i> endangers the
life of its father, but the misfortune is averted if the child and
its parents bathe in the water drawn from 108 wells. A
draught of such water is said to cure <i>Sannipat</i> or delirium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the sacred tanks of India is “the Lake of Immortality”
at Amritsar. The name of the city is taken from the
sacred tank in which the Golden Temple is built. Originally,
the place was only a natural pool of water and a favourite
resort of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion. It was
known at first as <i>Guru-ka-chall</i>, but later when the tank was
built, the name Amritsar was adopted, <i>amrit</i> meaning water
of immortality and <i>sar</i> meaning a tank. A holy woman
once took pity on a leper, and carried him to the banks of the
tank. As he lay there, a crow swooped into the water and
came out a dove as white as snow. Seeing the miracle, the
leper was tempted to bathe in the river and was healed. The
woman could not recognize her friend, and withdrew in horror
from his embraces. But the Guru Ram Dâs came and explained
matters, and “the grateful pair assisted him in embellishing
the tank, which has now become the centre of the
Sikh religion.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The tank at Lalitpur is similarly famous for the cure of
leprosy. One day, a Râjâ afflicted with the disease was
passing by, and his Râni dreamt that he should eat some of
the confervæ on the surface. He ate it, and was cured;
next night the Râni dreamt that there was a vast treasure
concealed there, which when dug up was sufficient to pay the
cost of excavation. At Qasur is the tank of the saint Basant
Shâh, in which children are bathed to cure them of boils.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>There are several hot springs in India renowned for their
curative powers. These also are believed to be sacred to certain
deities. A typical example is that of the hot kund, called
<i>Devki-Unai</i>, about 30 miles to the south of Surat. Many
pilgrims visit the place on the fifteenth day of the bright half of
<i>Chaitra</i>, when the waters are cool, to offer money, cocoanuts, and
red lead to the <i>Unai Mata</i>, whose temple stands near the kund.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
It is said that king Rama built this kund while performing
a sacrifice and brought water from the <i>pâtâl</i> (nether regions) by
shooting an arrow into the earth.</p>

<p>Similarly, the famous hot springs forming one group in a line
along the bed of the Tansa river in the village of Vadavli are
sacred to the goddess Vajrabai or Vajreshvari, the Lady of
the Thunderbolt. According to tradition, this neighbourhood
being full of demons the goddess Vajrabai became incarnate in
the locality to clear it of the wicked spirits. She routed the
whole lot of them, and the hot water of these springs is nothing
but the blood of one of the demons slain by her. Her
chronicle, or <i>Mahatmya</i>, is kept at the village of Gunj, some
six miles to the north, and her temple is placed at the top of a
flight of steps on a spur of the Sumatra range. A large fair is
held here in Chaitra (April). There are other hot springs in the
neighbouring villages of Akloli, known as the Rameshwar hot
springs, whose waters are gathered out in stone cisterns. In the
eighteenth century these springs were much used both by
Indians and Europeans as a cure for fevers. In his <i>Oriental
Memoirs</i> James Forbes describes the springs as consisting
of small cisterns of water with a temperature of 120°. “Except
that it wanted a small element of iron the water tasted like that
of Bath in England.” In the Ganeshpuri village, about three
miles west of Vajrabai, are the two hottest springs of the group.
These are resorted to by people troubled with skin diseases.</p>

<p>The Arabs regard the hot springs at Terka Main to be under
the control of a Vali who makes the fire and keeps it burning.
Those who go there to be healed of rheumatism invoke the
saint and keep up the fire so that the water may be hot. At
the Lunatic Asylum of Hamath there is a pool believed to be
the abode of a Vali who is the patron saint of all insane people.
He appears in the night and blesses the insane by touching
them. Even troublesome children come under the spell of his
influence. The Arabs take the robes of refractory urchins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the pool and wash them in it so as to instil wisdom and
obedience in the children.</p>

<p>Similarly, the special function of the Altarnum well was the
cure of madness. The afflicted person was made to stand with
his back to the pool and was then tumbled headlong into the
water by a sudden blow in the breast. In the water again
stood a strong fellow who took him and tossed him up and down.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
This ritual appears to be a survival of human sacrifice, while the
ritual followed in connection with St. Tecla’s well, renowned
for the cure of epilepsy, bears testimony to the practice of
offering animal sacrifices to the presiding spirits of water.</p>

<p>In his <i>Tour in Wales</i>, speaking of the village of Llandegla,
where is a church dedicated to St. Tecla, virgin and martyr, who
after her conversion by St. Paul suffered under Nero at Iconium,
Pennant says: “About two hundred yards from the church, in
a quillet called Gwern Degla, rises a small spring. The water
is under the tutelage of the saint, and to this day held to be
extremely beneficial in the falling sickness. The patient washes
his limbs in the well; makes an offering into it of four-pence;
walks round it three times; and thrice repeats the Lord’s Prayer.
These ceremonies are never begun till after sunset, in order to
inspire the votaries with greater awe. If the afflicted be of the
male sex, like Socrates, he makes an offering of a cock to his
Aesculapius, or rather to Tecla, Hygeia; if of the fair sex, a
hen. The fowl is carried in a basket, first round the well, after
that into the churchyard, when the same orisons and the same
circumambulations are performed round the church. The
votary then enters the church, gets under the communion-table,
lies down with the Bible under his or her head, is
covered with the carpet or cloth, and rests there till break of
day, departing after offering six pence, and leaving the
fowl in the church. If the bird dies, the cure is supposed
to have been effected and the disease transferred to the
devoted victim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The most famous healing well in England is perhaps the
Holywell, the Lourdes of Wales. The story of this well
is the story of St. Winefride, the waters of whose fount were
declared by the Protestant antiquarian, Pennant, to be
“almost as sanative as those of the Pool of Bethesda.” In
the 7th century the picturesque valley of Sychnant had
as its chieftain Thewith, whose wife was the sister of St. Beuno,
and whose daughter, Winefride, was a very beautiful girl, who
had many suitors, but who resolved to consecrate herself to
God in a life of virginity. One of the most persistent of her
suitors was Prince Caradoc, who, enraged at his rejection,
made a furious onslaught on the girl, compelling her to seek
safety in flight. With drawn sword he pursued and overtook
her on the majestic hill which overlooked the town. Here
he cut off her head, which rolled to the foot of the hill. Till
then, Sychnant had been waterless—its name, indeed, signifies
the dry valley, but at the spot where the severed head rested,
a copious stream burst forth, forming a well, the sides of which
were lined with fragrant moss, whilst the stones at the bottom
were tinctured with the youthful martyr’s blood. The head
itself was reunited by St. Beuno to Winefride’s body, which was
immediately restored to life by the Almighty in response to the
saint’s prayers. Winefride subsequently became a nun, dying
at Gwytherin on November 3rd, 1660.</p>

<p>Around the Well in Sychnant Valley grew a town which the
Saxons named Treffynion, and which became known to the
Normans as Haliwell, the hallowed or holy well, to which pilgrims
fared from all parts of the kingdom, inspired by the
belief that through the intercession of St. Winefride they would
obtain spiritual and temporal blessings. Through the centuries
preceding the Reformation, the Welsh Princes, the monarchs of
England and the nobles of both countries delighted to bestow
marks of their favour on Holywell and its shrine and Well of
St. Winefride. One of the greatest of these benefactors was the
mother of Henry VII., Margaret, Countess of Richmond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Derby, who, in the fifteenth century, erected the handsome
Gothic chapel and the Well beneath it. The water was received
in a magnificent polygonal basin, covered by a groined arch,
supported on pillars. The roof was elaborately carved in stone,
and many fine ribs secured the arch, whose intersections were
completed with sculpture. On one side of the wall was painted
the history of St. Winefride, whilst the arms of the foundress
and those of Henry VII., Henry VIII., Catherine of Aragon,
and other benefactors were incorporated in the decorations.</p>

<p>Though the church of Holywell was devoted to other uses
after the Reformation, and recourse to the well was regarded as
a “superstitious practice,” the tide of visitors never completely
ceased to flow. In 1629, for example, a spy is found reporting
Sir Cuthbert Clifton as being one of a great number of “Papists
and priests assembled at St. Winefride’s Well on St. Winefride’s
Day.”</p>

<p>The following paragraph from Archbishop Laud’s account
of his Province for the year 1633 also shows that in spite of
all repressive measures pilgrims resorted in great numbers to
the well:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Bishop of St. Asaph returns. That all is exceedingly
well in his diocese—save only that the number and boldness of
some Romish Recusants increaseth much in many Places, and
is encouraged by the superstitions and frequent concourse of
some of that party to Holy-Well, otherwise called St. Winifride’s
Well. Whether this Concourse be by way of Pilgrimage or no,
I know not; but I am sure it hath long been complained of
without remedy.”</p>

</div>

<p>One of the visitors in the year 1686 was James II: and in the
following year Father Thomas Roberts was appointed priest in
charge. The well has ever since been a favourite resort of stricken
pilgrims and the modern tourist in North Wales can still witness
numerous pilgrims journeying to St. Winefride’s in the hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
leaving their infirmities behind them. The deaf, the dumb, the
blind and the paralysed have for centuries betaken themselves
to this well in search of spiritual as well as physical health and
the votive crutches, chairs and barrows left hanging over the
well by the pilgrims who have been able to discard them bear
testimony to the healing virtues of its water or at least to the
faith of the people in such virtues.</p>

<p>In Lilly’s History of his life and times a story is given of
Sir George Peckham, Kt., who died in St. Winefride’s Well,
“having continued so long mumbling his paternosters and
<i>Sancta Winifreda ora pro me</i>, that the cold struck into his body
and after his coming forth of that well he never spoke more.”</p>

<p>Two recent Holywell cures were reported in the <i>Catholic
Times and Catholic Opinion</i> of 21st July 1916. Mr. John MacMullan,
whose address was 49 Station-Road, Shettleston, Glasgow,
decided to try the water of St. Winefride’s Well after suffering
for three years with chronic spinal disease. He bathed in the
waters for the first time on July 5th, and again on July 6th,
when he experienced a sharp shooting pain all through the body.
On July 10th after getting in the well he found that he was
able to walk up the steps which descended into the outer basin
of the well quite unaided and up to the 12th of July, when he
returned to Scotland, he was able to walk about freely.</p>

<p>The other noteworthy case following on a visit to St. Winefride’s
Well is that of Miss Elizabeth Stanley of 54, John Thomas
Street, Blackburn. She had her hand cut in a mill while
working as a weaver and was unable to work for two years.
In quest of a cure she made a pilgrimage to St. Winefride’s
Well on the Feast of Corpus Christi. “Since her return
from Holywell,” it is reported, “she has followed her work
without any ill effects and is at present in the best of health.”</p>

<p>While this chapter was being written, a great calamity befell
Holywell. Owing to the boring operations of the Halken
Draining Company the waters of this famous well that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
flowing for 1400 years were drained away on the 5th January
1917. The valley of Sychnant became once more “the dry
valley”, but to the great joy of the people of Holywell and of the
Catholic community everywhere the water was restored to
the well on the 22nd September 1917.</p>

<p>A few more healing wells in Great Britain may be noted.
The “Hooping Stone” on a farm near Athol, is a channeled
boulder which catches rain, and the water, especially if ladled
out with a spoon made from the horn of a living cow, cures
many ailments. The “Fever Well” hard by is also still in
high repute. The Mayor and Burgesses of Shaftesbury still go
to dance round the sacred springs of Enmore Green, hand in
hand to the sound of music—or did so until recently. They
carried a broom decked with feathers, gold rings, and jewels,
called a “prize bezant”, and presented to the bailiff of the
manor of Gillingham (where are the springs) a pair of gloves, a
raw calf’s head, a gallon of beer and two penny loaves.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Another holy well, Roche Holy Well of Cornwall, is famous
for curing eye diseases. This well, which is dedicated to the
lonely hermit by name St. Conan, is endowed on Holy
Thursday, and also the two Thursdays following, with the
property of curing eye diseases alike in young and old.</p>

<p>At Chapel Uny rickety children are dipped three times in the
well against the sun, and dragged three times round the well in
the same direction.</p>

<p>In several instances such miraculous cures appear to be
well authenticated. Mr. Colin Bennett says that Jesus Well,
St. Minver, and Madron Holy Well, near Penzance, are cases
in point. Bishop Hall, of Exeter, who visited the latter well
in 1640, absolutely vouches, in his treatise on the <i>Invisible
World</i>, for the cure of a man by name John Trelille who had
been lame from birth and had to crawl on all fours from place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to place. At last he decided to try the virtue of the waters of
this holy well for his complaint and, like Naaman of old, bathed
himself in the little spring, afterwards reclining for an hour and
a half on a grassy bank situated near by and known as St. Madrne’s
bed while a friend offered up simple prayers on his behalf.
On the first occasion of this treatment he got some relief,
on the second he was able to stand on his legs with the aid of
a staff and on the third occasion he found himself entirely cured.
It is even said that in later life he enlisted in the army and was
eventually killed in battle, having previously done good work
for his country’s cause. Others have also been cured of the
same affliction in later times by precisely the same means.
Close by this well is the ancient oratory of St. Madrne, where
on the first Sunday in May a service is still held by the Wesleyans
in commemoration of the saintly man who once preached
in that lonely spot the word of God. After the service the
Holy Well is visited by the people, some of whom, says Mr. Bennett,
“go so far as to consult it concerning futurity.”</p>

<p>Many springs in Macedonia are known and venerated as
“sacred waters”; dedicated to St. Friday and St. Solomoné
among feminine saints, or to St. Paul and St. Elias among their
male colleagues. The water of these springs is regarded as efficacious
against diseases, especially eye-complaints. Even so
stood enclosed the “fair-flowing fountain built by man’s hand,
whence the citizens of Ithaca drew water,” and close to it “an
altar erected in honour of the Nymphs, upon which the wayfarers
offered sacrifice.” Like the Homeric “fountain of the Nymphs”
many a modern “holy spring” is overshadowed by “water-bred
poplars or broad-leaved fig-trees, and weeping willows.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of cures are effected even now at the Church of
the Annunciation over the Chapel of the well during the Festival
of Annunciation at Tenos. During her visit to the place
Miss Hamilton saw priests spooning out the sacred water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
an eager crowd, one by one, “after the fashion of a medicine-giving
nurse.” Miss Hamilton is, however, guilty of repeating
a very blasphemous story concerning a spring of therapeutic
fame. Up to quite recent times the festival at Kaisariani
was very popular among the Athenians and sick people were
taken there for cure at the spring on the Ascension Day, the
only day on which the spring water ran into the little Chapel, and
in a miraculous way a white dove, the Holy Spirit, appeared
and wet its wings in the holy water. Then all the sick people
drank of the water or washed in it and expected to be healed.
One festival day this dove failed to appear, and the priest
knocked with his foot and whispered, “Let out the Holy
Spirit.” A voice from the hole replied audibly, “The cat has
eaten it.” This was enough to suppress the miracle.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage described by Miss Hamilton recalls the vivid
scenes in Emile Zola’s famous novel <i>Lourdes</i>. In that masterpiece
of his the great master of Médan has given us a marvellously
animated and poetic narrative of the annual national
pilgrimage to the famous Continental shrine. The idea of human
suffering pervades the whole story and the woful account of the
despairing sufferers given up by science and by man and of
the religious enthusiasm with which they address themselves
to a higher Power in the hope of relief and hasten to Lourdes
and crowd themselves round the miraculous Grotto, is touching
indeed. The author, no doubt, accompanies the stricken
pilgrims without sharing their belief in the virtues of the water
of Lourdes. He witnesses several instances of real cure, accepts
the extraordinary manifestations of the healing power of the
waters, but tries to account for them on scientific grounds.
Be the explanation as it may, <i>Lourdes</i> affords striking
illustrations of the faith of the people in the miracles of the
enchanted fountain.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">PROCREATIVE POWERS OF WATER SPIRITS.</span></h3>

<p>Water-spirits being authors of fertility in general, it is natural
that they should be credited with the power of fertilizing human
beings as well as animals. In many places the power of bestowing
offspring is ascribed to them, and several wells in India have
a reputation for conferring the blessings of parenthood.</p>

<p>The Hindus believe that “a son secures three worlds, a
grandson bliss, and a great grandson a seat even above the
highest heavens. By begetting a virtuous son one saves oneself
as well as the seven preceding and seven succeeding generations.”
Childless women, therefore, resort to various expedients.
Of these pilgrimages to shrines of saints and visits
to Faqirs and Mullas who have miraculous charms in their
possession are most common. But the most effective charm
is water. In many parts of India the water of seven wells is
collected on the night of the Dewali, or feast of lamps, and
barren women bathe in it as a means of procuring children.
A more elaborate ritual is observed by the domiciled Hindus
of Baluchistan. There the childless woman takes water from
seven different wells, tanks or springs and places into it leaves
of seven kinds of fruit-bearing trees. She then doffs her
clothes, wraps a cotton sheet around her and sits over the
board of a spinning wheel under the wooden spout of a house,
with some of the leaves under her feet. Another woman,
blest with living children, mounts to the top of the house,
and pours the mystical water on the roof so that it trickles
over the childless woman through the spout. After the
bath she dons new clothes and greets her husband and impregnation
takes place immediately. The same ceremony is resorted
to in cases in which successive girls have been born,
and the birth of a son is assured.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>In a <i>vav</i> in Orissa priests throw betel-nuts into the mud
and barren women scramble for them. Those who find
them will have their desire for children gratified. For
the same reason, the mother is taken after childbirth to
worship the village well. She walks round it in the course
of the sun and smears the platform with red lead, which
is a survival of the original rite of blood sacrifice. In Dharwar
the child of a Brahman is taken in the third month to
worship water at the village well. There is also a belief in
Gujarat that barren couples get children if they bathe in a
waterfall and offer cocoanuts.</p>

<p>In the Punjab sterile women desiring offspring are let down
into a well on a Sunday or a Tuesday night during the Dewali.
After the bath they are drawn up again and they perform the
<i>Chaukpurna</i> ceremony with incantations. When this ceremony
has been performed, the well is supposed to run dry. Its quickening
and fertilizing virtue has been abstracted by the woman.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
This practice has its counterpart in a custom observed by Syrian
women at the present day. Some of the channels of the Orontos
are used for irrigation, but at a certain season of the year
the streams are turned off and the dry bed of the channels
is cleared of mud and other impurities, obstructing a free flow
of water. The first night that the water is turned on again, it
is said to have the power of procreation. Accordingly, barren
women take their places in the channel, waiting for the entrance
of the water-spirit in the rush of the stream.</p>

<p>Sir James Frazer says that in Scotland the same fertilizing
virtue used to be, and probably still is, ascribed to certain
springs. Wives who wished to become mothers formerly resorted
to the well of St. Fillan at Comrie and to the wells of
St. Mary at Whitekirk and in the Isle of May. In the Aran
Islands, off the coast of Galway, women desirous of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
pray at St. Eany’s Well and the men pray at the Rag Well by
the Church of the Four Comely Ones at Onaght. Similarly,
Child’s Well in Oxford was supposed to have “the virtue of
making barren women to bring forth.” Near Bingfield in
Northumberland there is a copious sulphur spring known as the
Borewell. About Midsummer day a great fair is held there and
barren women pray at the well that they might become mothers.</p>

<p>Some folklorists, Sir James Frazer included, consider that
sterility was believed by people to be a disease due, as in the case
of other maladies, to the work of demoniacal agency. They
therefore include this practice of bathing in wells for the
blessings of motherhood in the same category in which they place
the cult of the bath based on popular faith in the healing powers
of water. But there is probably another explanation for this
practice. Students of the rites and customs observed by the
Semitic people are aware that procreative power was attributed
by these people to the spirits. Professor Curtiss bears
testimony to this and he says that even Moslems and Christians
of Syria conceived of God as possessed of a complete male
organism. It was a common belief amongst the Syrians that the
genii, both male and female, had sexual intercourse with human
beings and the view that the spirits of the dead may beget children
also prevailed. When a man had been executed for murder
in Jerusalem, about fifty years ago, some barren women rushed
up to the corpse. It may be, says Curtiss, that they felt that,
inasmuch as the man had been released by death from previous
nuptials and was free, as a disembodied spirit, he was endowed
with supernatural power to give them the joy of motherhood
by proximity to his dead body. After his recent researches
in Syria Curtiss says that this belief in the procreative powers
of the dead is still common.</p>

<p>There are three places at the so-called baths of Solomon in
Syria, where the hot air comes out of the ground. One of these
hot air vents, called Abu Rabah, is a famous shrine for women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
who are barren and desire children. They in fact regard the
<i>Vali</i> (Saint) of the shrine as the father of children born after such
a visit, as appears from the English rendering of an Arabic
couplet, which they repeat as they go inside the small inclosure
and allow the hot air to steam up their bodies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">To thee come the fair ones;</div>
<div class="verse">With thee is the generation,</div>
<div class="verse">With us is the conception.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These verses clearly unfold the minds of the women who woo
the spirits for the joys of motherhood. May not the corresponding
faith of Indian women in sanctified waters be traced to
similar ideas? The Bombay and Orissa practices described
above do not materially support that view, but the Punjab
practice and the belief of the Punjabis that the well runs dry
after the bath and that its fertilizing virtue is abstracted by
the women bathing in it are very significant.</p>

<p>The Jews also believed in the possibility of conception occurring
in a bath <i>in quo spermatizaverat homo</i>. Ben Sira was said to
have been the son of a daughter of Jeremiah who became <i>enceinte</i>
from her father in that way. “Indeed,” says Dr. Feldman,
“the Rabbi who expressed himself as a believer in such an occurrence
was Simon ben Zoma, a sage of the second century A.D.,
who devoted a good deal of his time to metaphysical problems,
and whose mind gave way in consequence. The question that
was asked of him, no doubt sarcastically, was whether the High
Priest, who may only marry a virgin, was allowed to marry a
pregnant virgin. Ben Zoma answered the question in the
affirmative, because, said he, conception was possible in a bath
in which a man had just before washed himself.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This theory, observes Dr. Feldman, was still in vogue even
among physicians of the twelfth century. Averroes, an Arabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
physician who died in 1198, records that an acquaintance of his,
whose <i>bona fide</i> was beyond dispute, stated on her oath that
<i>impregnata fuerat subito in balneo lavelti aquæ calidæ in quo
spermatizaverunt mali homines cum essent balneati in illo
balneo</i>. Another author explains the possibility of such an
occurrence as follows: <i>Quia vulva trahit sperma propter suam
propriam virtutem</i>.</p>

<p>“In the sixteenth century,” continues Dr. Feldman, “we
find the Portuguese Amatus Lusitanus (1550) making use of the
same theory to explain the delivery of a mole by a nun; and,
according to Stern, this belief is prevalent in Turkey even at the
present day. The Rabbis of the Middle Ages also believed in
such a possibility. Even as late as the beginning of the eighteenth
century this belief prevailed, and R. Juda Rozanes, Rabbi
of Constantinople, who, on the authority of Maimonides, considered
such an occurrence improbable, was reprimanded by
Azulai.”</p>

<p>In Scotland persons who bore the name of the river Tweed
were supposed to have as ancestors the genii of the river
of that name. Could this curious belief have sprung from
similar ideas concerning the procreative powers of the water-spirits?</p>

<p>These conceptions of the generative power of water have
their parallel in a Semong tradition. These people, among
whom marital relationship is preceded by great ante-nuptial
freedom, have a legend of a people in their old home, composed
of women only. “These women know not men, but when the
moon is at the full, they dance naked in the grassy places near
the salt lakes, the evening wind is their only spouse, and
through him they conceive and bear children.”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">WISHING AND CURSING WELLS.</span></h3>

<p>In East and West alike there are oracular wells inhabited
by spirits gifted with powers of divination. The instance
of the well in Ghoga Street in Bombay has already been noted.
There is a <i>kund</i> in Baladana near Wadhawan, dedicated
to Hol, the favourite <i>mata</i> of the Charans. In this <i>kund</i>,
black or red <i>gagar bedinus</i> pieces of cotton thread are
sometimes seen floating on the water. They appear only for
a moment, and sink if any one endeavours to seize them. The
appearance of black pieces forbodes famine; but the red ones
foretell prosperity. At Askot, in the Himalayas, there is a
holy well which is used for divining the prospects of the
harvest. If the spring in a given time fills the brass vessel
to the brim into which the water falls, there will be a good
season; if only a little water comes, drought may be expected.
In a well in Kashmir those who have any special desires throw
a nut. If it floats, it is considered an omen of success. If it
sinks, it is a sign of misfortune.</p>

<p>With this may be compared the divinations performed by
sailors at the fountain of Recoverance or St. Laurent. To
know the future state of the weather they cast on the waters
of the fountain a morsel of bread. If the bread floats, says
Evans Wentz in <i>Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries</i>, it is a sure
sign of fair weather, but if it sinks, of weather so bad that no
one should venture to go out in the fishing boats. Similarly,
in some wells, pins are dropped by lovers. If the pins float,
the water-spirits give a promise of favourable auspices, but if
the pins sink, the maiden is unhappy, and will hesitate in
accepting the proposal of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The most famous modern oracle in Greece is the well at Amorgos.
It stands in a little side shrine, where the priest offers
a prayer to St. George. Then he draws some water from
the well in a small vessel and diagnoses the contents. The
rules for the interpretation are quite lengthy, but the answers
are usually ambiguous. These answers are given according
to the foreign matter in the water. For example, hair denotes
trouble and sickness.</p>

<p>Near Kirkmichael in Banff there is a fountain, once
highly celebrated and anciently dedicated to St. Michael. Many
a patient has by its waters been restored to health, and many
more have attested the efficacy of their virtues. But, as the
presiding power is sometimes capricious, and apt to desert his
charge, the fountain now lies neglected, choked with weeds,
unhonoured and unfrequented. In better days, it was not
so; for the winged guardian, under the semblance of a fly,
was never absent from his duty. If the sober matron wished to
know the issue of her husband’s ailment, and the love-sick
nymph that of her languishing swain, they visited the
well of St. Michael. Every movement of the sympathetic fly
was regarded in silent awe; and as he appeared cheerful or
dejected, the anxious votaries drew their presages; and their
breasts vibrated with corresponding emotions.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, at a Cornish well, people used to go and inquire
about absent friends. If the person “be living and in health,
the still, quiet waters of the well-pit will instantly bubble
or boil up as a pot of clear, crystal-like water; if sick, foul
and puddled water; if dead, it will neither boil nor bubble
up, nor alter its colour or stillness.”</p>

<p>In his Monastic Remains, More refers to the existence of two
wishing wells in Walsingham Chapel. “The wishing wells,”
he observes, “still remain, two circular stone pits filled with water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
enclosed with a square wall, where the pilgrims used to kneel
and throw in a piece of gold whilst they prayed for the accomplishment
of their wishes.”</p>

<p>Pennant in his account of St. Winefride’s well says: “Near
the steps, two feet beneath the water is a large stone, called
the wishing stone. It receives many a kiss from the faithful
who are supposed never to fail in experiencing the completion
of their desires, provided the wish is delivered with full devotion
and confidence.”</p>

<p>Another famous wishing well is in Cornwall, named the Fairy
Well, Carbis Bay. After the enquirer has formed his wish with
his back to the well, he throws a pin over his left shoulder.
If it strikes the water he obtains his wish, if it falls on the bank,
he is disappointed. “The little well,” says Mr. Colin Bennett
in the <i>Good Words Magazine</i>, “is much resorted to at the
present day by tourists and all those who have a sense of the
quaintness or romance of such ancient observances.”</p>

<p>The priestess of Gulval Well in Fosses Moor was an old woman
who instructed the devotees in their ceremonial observances.
They had to kneel down and lean over the well so as to see
their faces in the water and repeat after their instructor a
rhyming incantation, after which, the reply of the spirit of
the well was interpreted by the bubbling of the water or its
quiescence.</p>

<p>Just as there are wishing wells, there are cursing wells also,
scattered through Europe, particularly in Celtic countries.
The Kelts of Bretagne, says Major-General Forlong,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> still fear
not only “our Lady of Hate,” but also the “Well of Cursing.”
The belief was, and perhaps still is, that if certain evil rites
are performed, and a stone inscribed with the enemy’s name is
thrown into such a well, the victim will pine away and die,
unless he who has inflicted the curse relents, and removes the
baneful charm ere it be too late.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the well of St. Aelian, not far from Betteas Abergeley
in Denbighshire, resided a woman who officiated as a kind of
priestess. Any one who wished to inflict a curse upon an enemy
resorted to this priestess, and for a trifling sum she registered
in a book kept for the purpose the name of the person on whom
the curse was intended to fall. A pin was then dropped into
the well in the name of the victim and the curse was
complete.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Varied indeed are the virtues of Holy Wells and the wonders
connected with them. A peculiar property of the water of
St. Keyne is that whoever first drinks of it after marriage
becomes the ruler in the household. “I know not,”
says Fuller, “whether it be worth the reporting, that there is
in Cornwall, near the parish of St. Neots, a well, arched over
with the robes of four kinds of trees, withy, oak, elm, and ash,
dedicated to St. Keyne. The reported virtue of the water is
this, that whether husband or wife come first to drink thereof,
they get the mastery thereby.” After his visit to Cornwall
Southey celebrated this well in the famous poem, “The Well
of St. Keyne.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“St. Keyne,” quoth the Cornish-man, “many a time</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Drank of this crystal Well,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the foot of Carn Brea Hill is a little well dedicated to St.
Eunius. To be baptised in the water drawn from this is a
sure safeguard against death by hanging.</p>

<p>Of the Rin Mochan pool the Brahmins say that any one
who bathes there becomes free from debt.</p>

<p>Strange traditions are not wanting, says Mr. Colin Bennett,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
to account for the wonderful state in which these wells are
preserved. It is impossible to remove the stones of the well of
St. Cleer, which is situated near Liskeard. True, they may be
carted away at daytime, but they all return at night and
deposit themselves in heaps on the site from which they were
taken. Similar stories are related of the marvellous powers of
the basin which catches the water as it issues from the spring at
St. Nun’e Well, Pelynt, near Looe and of the Bisland Holy
Well the ground surrounding which can never be broken for
tillage on penalty of disaster to the family of the person
attempting to do so.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">MALEFICENT WATER-GOBLINS.</span></h3>

<p>So far we have met beneficent spirits of the divine sea and
blessed springs and wells. Let us not forget that there are also
maleficent deities and mischievous water-goblins infesting ill-omened
streams and wells. In India where the lives
and fortunes of cattle and people alike hang on the precarious
seasonal rainfall, the water-spirits are as a rule regarded as
friendly dispensers of life and fertility. Even the sea-gods are
on the whole beneficent beings. The <i>Darya-Pirs</i> of the Luvanas
(merchants) and Kharvas (sailors) are devoid of mischief and are
regarded as patron saints. Elsewhere, however, the perils of
the deep and rapid rivers and treacherous pools gave the water-spirits
a bad name and their fury emphasized the need for
propitiating them with sacrifices. Thus it comes to pass
that western folklore abounds in blood-thirsty water-demons
who are very often conceived as hideous serpents or dragons.
But, as we have already noticed, people of India also have
their mischievous water-sprites, the <i>Mâtâs</i> and <i>Shankhinies</i>
who haunt wayside wells and either drown or enterthe
persons of those who go near their wells. These ghosts and
goblins—<i>bhuts</i> and <i>prets</i>—are known as <i>Jalachar</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, living in
water, as contrasted with <i>Bhuchar</i>, those hovering on the earth.
One has to propitiate these malignant deities and spirits.</p>

<p>It is believed that most of the demons haunting wells and
tanks are the spirits of those who have met death by drowning.
There are also the spirits of those who die of accidents
before the fulfilment of their worldly desires or the souls
of the deceased who do not receive the funeral <i>pindas</i> with the
proper obsequies. These fallen souls in their <i>avagati</i> or
degraded condition reside near the scene of their death and
molest those who approach the water. There is a <i>vav</i> called
<i>Nilkanth vav</i> near Movaiya, in which a <i>Pinjari</i> (a female cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
carder) is said to have been drowned and to have been turned
into a ghost, in which form she occasionally presents herself to
the people.</p>

<p>Another <i>vav</i> in Vadhwan is haunted by a ghost called Mahda,
who drowns one human being every third year as a victim.
But a male spirit, named Kshetrapal, resides in the <i>kotta</i> (or
entrance) of the <i>vav</i>, and saves those who fall near the entrance.
Those who fall in any other part are, however, sure to be
drowned.</p>

<p>There is in Mirzapur a famous water-hole, known as Barewa.
A herdsman was once grazing his buffaloes near the place,
when the waters rose in fury and carried him off with his cattle.
The drowned buffaloes have now taken the form of a dangerous
demon known as <i>Bhainsasura</i>, or the buffalo-demon,
and he lives there in company with the Naga and the Nagin
and none dare fish there until he has propitiated these demons
with the offerings of a fowl, eggs and goat.</p>

<p>Until recently the Bengalis believed that a water-spirit
in the form of an old hag called <i>Jaté Buddi</i> haunted
tanks and ponds and fettered with an invisible chain the feet
of persons who approached her territories. Even to this day
the name of this witch is taken to frighten naughty children.
Another Bengal spirit, called <i>Jakh</i>, was believed to reside
in tanks and to guard hidden treasure. Woe to the man who
threw covetous eyes on that treasure! The Sion Indians
believe in a water-demon called Unk-tahe who, like the Siamese
spirit Pnuk, drags underneath the water those who go to bathe
in it.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Corresponding to these haunted wells are the water holes
in Scotland, known as the “cups of the fairies,” and the Trinity
Well in Ireland into which no one can gaze with impunity,
and from which the river Bayne once burst forth in pursuit of
a lady who had insulted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>In Indian folklore this wicked class of water-nymphs is
known as Apsarás. The village of Mith-Báv in Ratnagiri is
a well-known resort of these nymphs and the villagers relate
many a thrilling story of persons drowned and carried off by
them in the river. Another favourite habitat of these water-spirits
is a tank in the village of Hindalem in the same district.
Every reservoir of water in Thana is believed to be a habitat
of water-nymphs. Some, however, believe that they dwell
only in those lakes in which lotuses grow. The images of seven
<i>apsarás</i> are particularly worshipped by the people, <i>viz.</i>, Machhi,
Kurmi, Karkati, Darduri, Jatupi, Somapa and Makari.</p>

<p>Greek folklore represents these nymphs as tall and slim, clad in
white, with flowing golden hair, and divinely beautiful, so much
so that the highest compliment that can be paid to a Greek maiden
is to compare her in loveliness to a Neraida. Such beauty, however,
is fatal to the beholder and many a story is related of people
who having exposed themselves to its fascination were bereft of
speech or suffered otherwise. A single illustration will suffice.
In the island of Chios is a bridge called the Maid’s Bridge, which is
popularly believed to be haunted by a water-spirit. Early one
morning a man was crossing the bridge on his way from the village
of Daphnona to the capital city, when he met a tall young
woman dressed in white. She took him by the hand and made
him dance with her. He was foolish enough to speak and was
immediately struck dumb. He recovered, however, some days
after, thanks to the prayers and exorcisms of a priest.</p>

<p>So too the sirens frequent an island near the coast of Italy
and entice seamen by the sweetness of their song which is so
bewitching that the listeners forget everything and die of
hunger. In Homeric mythology there were only two sirens,
later writers named three, and the number has since been
augmented by those who loved “lords many and gods many.”</p>

<p>Plato says there are three kinds of sirens—the celestial,
the generative and the cathartic. The first are under the
government of Jupiter, the second under the government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Neptune, and the third under the government of Pluto. When
the soul is in heaven, the sirens seek, by harmonic motion, to
unite it to the divine life of the celestial host; and when in
Hades, to conform them to the infernal regimen, but on earth
they produce generation, of which the sea is emblematic.</p>

<p>We may tarry a little here to greet a beneficent class of sea-nymphs.
These are the Nereids, fifty in number, named after
Nereid, daughter of Nereus, the sea-god whose sway extended
over the Ægean Sea. Camoens, in his <i>Lusiad</i>, has spiritualised
their office, and he makes them the sea-guardians of the virtuous.
According to a legend they went before the fleet of Vasco da
Gama, and when the treacherous pilot supplied by the King
of Mozambique steered his ship towards a sunken rock, these
guardian nymphs pressed against the prow, lifting it from the
water and turning it round.</p>

<p>To turn back to the malevolent spirits. At Dervinato, a
village in the island of Chios, there is a fountain-head, or “water
mother,” the common Greek expression for a spring, called
Plaghia, which is reputed to be the haunt of a Black Giant.
This monster is a crafty demon of Oriental origin who lures the
guileless to destruction by various stratagems, generally
by assuming the form of a fair maid. He is a being mortally
dreaded by the peasantry, and is not so often met with as
the water-spirit.</p>

<p>There is also the Drakos, a cousin-german to the Black
Giant. Like the Black Giant he also haunts the wells and
works mischief on the people by withholding the water. This
trick of the monster is alluded to in the following lines, which
form the beginning of a song heard at Nigrita:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yonder at St. Theodore’s, yonder at St. George’s,</div>
<div class="verse">A fair was held, a great fair.</div>
<div class="verse">The space was narrow and the crowd was large.</div>
<div class="verse">The Drakos held back the water and the people were athirst,</div>
<div class="verse">Athirst was also a lady who was heavy with child.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>In Greek legends the Drakos figures as a large uncouth
monster akin to the Troll of Norse and the Ogre and Giant of
British and Continental fairy tales. His simplicity of mind is
only equalled by his might and he is easily bamboozled. He
is also regarded as a performer of superhuman feats. As in
Ireland there is a Giant’s Causeway, so in Macedonia we find a
“Drakos’s Weight” (a big stone to the south of Nigrita), a
“Drakos’s Shovelful,” (a mound of earth), a “Drakos’s Tomb,”
a rock in the same neighbourhood, resembling a high-capped
<i>Dervish</i>, resting against the slope of the hill, and a “Drakos’s
Quoits,” two solitary rocks standing in the plain of Serres.</p>

<p>Various superstitions concerning drowning can be easily traced
to this belief in mischievous water-spirits. These spirits
demand human sacrifices and those who get drowned are
supposed to be their victims. Thus, when in Germany a
person comes by his death from drowning, the Germans say:
“The river-spirit claims his annual sacrifice,” or that “the nix
has taken the drowned man.” In India <i>pujas</i> are invariably
offered to propitiate these spirits before any member of a family
starts on a journey involving the crossing of the deep or of the
rivers. While passing over creeks and streams, travellers on
the Indian Railways will notice even to-day many a traveller,
Hindu and Parsi, male and female, throwing from the train
cocoanuts, sugar and flowers in the water in the devout hope
of averting accidents. The followers of Islam, however, believe
that God Almighty would, by reason of the benign influence
of His name, preserve them from drowning. Therefore, whilst
starting on a voyage they chant the following couplet from
Surah Nooh of the <i>Koran</i>, as a protective from drowning:—</p>

<p><i>Bismillaheh Majriha O Mursaha inna Rabi-ul-ghafur ul-Rahim</i>,
meaning, “The moving and stopping (of this boat, Noah’s
Ark) depends upon the influence of the Name of God,
for, in truth, our Lord is pre-eminently a Pardoner of sins and
merciful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same way Bengal boatmen cry “Badar,” “Badar,”
when a boat is in danger of capsizing, in the hope that the
saint Khwaja Khizr would protect them.</p>

<p>Others wear amulets to ward off the danger of drowning.
In “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,” Miss Bird says that the
amulet which saves the Japs from drowning is “a certain cure
for choking, if courageously swallowed.” Some sailors believe
that if a portion of the cowl which covers the face of some
children at the time of birth be worn as an amulet round the
neck, the person wearing it will not get drowned, while some
Bengalees believe that if a person accidentally eats ants along
with sweets or any foodstuff, he will not get drowned.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Once, however, a man is in the grip of the water-spirit,
to venture to save him is, according to various widespread
beliefs, sure to bring on disaster. In several places, therefore,
including Great Britain, people show great reluctance to save
a drowning person, because, as suggested by Tylor, they fear
the vengeance of the water-spirit, who would, in consequence,
be deprived of his prey.</p>

<p>Thus we gather from Tudor’s <i>Orkney and Shetland</i>, that
amongst the seamen of those places it was deemed unlucky
to rescue persons from drowning since it was held as a matter
of religious faith that the sea was entitled to certain victims, and
that, if deprived, it would avenge itself on those who interfere.
The still more cautious and considerate people in the Solomon
Islands go a step further. If a man accidentally falls into the
river and a shark attacks him, he is not allowed to escape.
If he does succeed in eluding the shark, his fellow-tribesmen
will throw him back to his doom, believing him to be marked
out for sacrifice to the god of the river.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>In his “Folk Medicine” Black accounts for this superstition
on the ground that it is believed that the spirits of people
who have died a violent death may return to earth if they can
find a substitute and that hence the soul of the last dead man
would feel insulted or injured by anyone preventing another
from taking his place. Some people on the other hand believe
that the reluctance to save drowning persons is due to the belief
that the person rescued from being drowned would inflict
mischief on the man who saves his life. It would seem from
Walter Scott’s novel<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> that this belief prevailed in Scotland.
In it asks the pedlar Bryce: “Are you mad? You that have
lived so long in Zetland to risk the saving of a drowning man?
Wot ye not if we bring him to life again, he will be sure to do
you capital injury?”</p>

<p>This superstition appears to have been confined to the West
only. In the East, luckily, there is no such antipathy to extend
a helping hand to the drowning. It may be mentioned, however,
that in his <i>Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India</i>
Crooke seems to suggest that this feeling is also common in
India, but he cites no examples although he gives several
instances and quotes several authorities concerning the Western
ideas on the subject. We, however, find no such instance
recorded anywhere. In the year 1893 Mr. Sarat Chandra Mitra
read before the Anthropological Society of Bombay a paper on
some superstitions regarding drowning. He quoted several
Western examples concerning the aversion to save drowning
people but gave no parallel for any of these from the folklore
of Bengal and Upper India with which he is intimately
familiar. If such antipathy did exist, that indefatigable student
of Indian folklore would have certainly heard of it.</p>

<p>Crooke appears to have confounded two separate, though
analogous, ideas, and to have assumed that the prevalence of
one connotes the existence of the other. There is, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
abundant evidence in Indian folklore to show that it was believed
throughout this country that the spirits of those persons
who got drowned wandered for a hundred years if their
corpses were not properly and solemnly buried with all the requisite
ceremonies. The spirits of the drowned are, therefore,
believed to haunt those rivers and wells and tanks in which
they have found their graves, just as the fisher-folk of England
believed that the spirits of the sailors who were drowned by a
shipwreck frequented those parts of the shores near which the
shipwreck took place. In his “Romances in the West of
England” Hunt refers to these superstitions. The mere prevalence,
however, of one of the superstitious beliefs of the
same class in two countries does not warrant the sweeping
assertion that the other beliefs also prevail in both the countries.</p>

<span class="smaller">RIVER WRAITHS.</span></h3>

<p>The worst of all ill-omened streams in India is the dread
<i>Vaitaranî</i>, the river of death, which is localized in Orissa and
which pours its stream of ordure and blood on the confines of
the realm of Yama.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Ill fares the man who in that dread hour
lacks the aid of a priest and the holy cow to help him to the
other shore. But the Indian water furies are easily propitiated.
Goats, or fish, or fowl, or even flowers and cocoanuts are enough
to appease them. Thus the Tapti and the Sutlej receive goats,
whereas the Jata Rohini, the Deo infesting the Karsa, a river
in Mirzapur, is pleased with a fish caught by the Buiga and
presented to him. Many of the continental water deities, however,
must needs have human sacrifices, just as the African
river spirit Prah, who must have every year in October two
human sacrifices, one male and one female. Thus in England
the River Tees, the Skerne, and the Ribble have each a sprite,
who, in popular belief, demands human victims. The Ribble’s
sprite is known by the name of Peg O’Nell, and a spring in the
grounds of Waddow bears her name and is graced by a stone
image, now headless, which, according to Sir Laurence Gomme,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
is said to represent her. A tradition connects the Peg O’Nell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
with an ill-used servant at Waddow Hall, who, in revenge for
her mistress’s successful malediction in causing her death, was
inexorable in demanding every seven years a life to be
quenched in the waters of the Ribble. “Peg’s night” was the
closing night of the septenniate, and when it came round, unless
a bird, a cat, or a dog was drowned in the stream, some human
being was certain to fall a victim there.</p>

<p>The sprite of the Tees is called Peg Powler, a sort of Lorelei,
says Henderson in his <i>Folklore of Northern Counties</i>, with green
tresses and an insatiable desire for human life. Children were
warned from playing on the banks of this river by threats that
Peg Powler would drag them into the water.</p>

<p>A horrid Kelpie or water-horse is said to infest the Yore,
near Middleham. Every evening he rises from the stream and
ramps along the meadows searching for prey, and it is believed
that the Kelpie claims at least one human victim annually.</p>

<p>The River Spey must also have at least one victim yearly, while</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Blood-thirsty Dee</div>
<div class="verse">Each year needs three.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another curious belief concerning the Dee may also be noted.
In his <i>Itinerary through Wales</i> Giraldus Cambrensis states that
the inhabitants of places near Chester assert that the waters of
the river change their fords every month and that as it
inclines more towards England or Wales they can with
certainty prognosticate which nation will be successful or
unfortunate during the year.</p>

<p>The saying runs that “St. John the Baptist must have a
runner, must have a swimmer, must have a climber.” As if
this were not enough, in Cologne he requires no less than seven
swimmers and seven climbers.</p>

<p>Even to this day some German rivers, such as the Saale and
the Spree, require their victims on Midsummer Day. During that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
parlous season people are careful not to bathe in it. Again,
where the beautiful Neckar flows under the ruins of Heidleberg
Castle, the spirit of the river seeks to drown three persons,
one on Midsummer Eve, one on Midsummer Day, and one on
the day after. On these nights if you hear a shriek, as of a
drowning man or woman from the water, beware of running
to the rescue; for it is only the water-fairy shrieking to lure
you to your doom. In Voigtland it was formerly the practice
to set up a fine May tree, adorned with all kinds of things, on
<i>St. John’s Day</i>. The people danced round it, and when the
lads had fetched down the things with which it was tricked
out, the tree was thrown into the water. But before this was
done, they sought out somebody whom they treated in the
same manner, and the victim of this horseplay was called “the
John.” The brawls and disorders, which this custom provoked,
led to a suppression of the whole ceremony which was obviously
only a modification of an older custom of actually drowning a
human being. At Rotenberg on the Neckar people throw a
loaf of bread into the water on St. John’s Day, otherwise
the river-god would grow angry and carry away a man.
Elsewhere, however, the water-sprite is content with flowers.
In Bohemia people cast garlands in the water on Midsummer
Eve and if the water-sprite pulls one of them down, it
is a sign that the person who threw the garland in will die.
In the villages of Hesse the girl who first comes to a well
early in the morning of Midsummer Day places on the mouth
of the well a gay garland of many sorts of flowers culled by her
from fields and meadows. Sometimes a number of such garlands
are twined together to form a crown with which the well is
decked. At Fluda, in addition to the floral decorations of the
wells, the neighbours choose a Lord of the Wells and announce
his election by sending him a great nosegay of flowers. His
house is decorated with green boughs and children walk in
procession to it. He goes from house to house collecting materials
for a feast, of which the neighbours partake on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Sunday. What the other duties of the Lord of Wells may be,
we are not told. We may however conjecture, says Sir James
Frazer, that in old days he had to see to it that the spirits
of the water received their dues from men and maidens on
that important day.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In those moments of the civilized man’s life when he casts
off hard dull science, and returns to childhood’s fancy, the world-old
book of animated nature is open to him anew. Then, says
Tylor, the well-worn thoughts come back fresh to him, of the
stream’s life that is so like his own; once more he can see the rill
leap down the hillside like a child, to wander playing among the
flowers; or can follow it as, grown to a river, it rushes through
a mountain gorge, henceforth in sluggish strength to carry heavy
burdens across the plain. In all that water does, the poet’s
fancy can discern its personality of life. It gives fish to the
fisher, and crops to the husbandman; it swells in fury and lays
waste the land; it grips the bather with chill and cramp, and
holds with inexorable grasp its drowning victim:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Tweed said to Till,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘What gars ye tin sae still?’</div>
<div class="verse">Till said to Tweed,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘Though ye rin wi’ speed,</div>
<div class="verse">And I rin slaw,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Yet, where ye drown ae man,</div>
<div class="verse">I drown twa.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What ethnography has to teach of that great element of the
religion of mankind, the worship of well and lake, brook and
river, is simply this that what is poetry to us was philosophy to
early man; that to his mind water acted not by laws of force,
but by life and will; that the water-spirits of primeval mythology
are as souls which cause the water’s rush and rest, its kindness
and its cruelty; that lastly man finds, in the beings which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with such power can work him weal and woe, deities with a wider
influence over his life, deities to be feared and loved, to be
prayed to and praised and propitiated with sacrificial gifts.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>“In Australia,” continues Tylor, “special water-demons
infest pools and watering places. In the native theory of disease
and death, no personage is more prominent than the water-spirit,
which afflicts those who go into unlawful pools or bathe at unlawful
times, the creature which causes women to pine and die,
and whose very presence is death to the beholder, save to the
native doctors, who may visit the water-spirit’s subaqueous abode
and return with bleared eyes and wet clothes to tell the wonders
of their stay. It would seem that creatures with such attributes
come naturally into the category of spiritual beings, but in such
stories as that of the bunyip living in the lakes and rivers
and seen floating as big as a calf, which carries off native
women to his retreat below the waters, there appears that confusion
between the spiritual water-demon and the material
water-monster, which runs on into the midst of European mythology
in such conceptions as that of the water-kelpie and the sea-serpent.”</p>

<p>The same confusion of ideas is seen in the Macedonian ballad
of the Haunted Well. Here too the spirit or demon of the well
is confounded with the water-serpent. The ballad, as quoted
in Mr. Abbott’s <i>Macedonian Folklore</i>, runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center">THE HAUNTED WELL.</p>
<div class="verse">Four and five, nine brothers,</div>
<div class="verse">Eighteen cousins, lads of little luck:</div>
<div class="verse">A message came to them from the King, bidding them</div>
<div class="verse">To go forth and fight in the far-off land of the Franks:</div>
<div class="verse">“Thy blessing, mother, that we may go forth!”</div>
<div class="verse">“May ye go forth nine brothers and come back eight;</div>
<div class="verse">May John the youngest never return!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<div class="verse">They set forth, and as they crossed the vast plain,</div>
<div class="verse">They lived forty days without bread,</div>
<div class="verse">Forty-five more without water,</div>
<div class="verse">And then they found a dear little fount; but it was a spirit-haunted well:</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas thirty fathoms in depth; in breadth twenty.</div>
<div class="verse">“Halt, dear brothers and let us cast lots,</div>
<div class="verse">He on whom the lot will fall, let him go in,”</div>
<div class="verse">The lot falls on John, the youngest.</div>
<div class="verse">They bind John and let him down:</div>
<div class="verse">“Draw, dear brothers, draw me out,</div>
<div class="verse">Here there is no water; but only a Spirit.”</div>
<div class="verse">“We are drawing, John, we are drawing; but thou stirrest not.”</div>
<div class="verse">“The serpent has wound itself round my body, the Spirit is holding me.</div>
<div class="verse">Come, set the Black One also to help you.”</div>
<div class="verse">When the Black One heard, he neighed loud.</div>
<div class="verse">He reared on his haunches to draw him out.</div>
<div class="verse">When he drew out his arms, the mountains gleamed,</div>
<div class="verse">He draws out his sword also, and the sea gleamed.</div>
<div class="verse">They drew out John together with the spirit,</div>
<div class="verse">They lifted their knives to cut it asunder,</div>
<div class="verse">But instead of cutting the Spirit they cut the rope,</div>
<div class="verse">And John falls in together with the Spirit:</div>
<div class="verse">“Leave me, brothers, leave me and go home,</div>
<div class="verse">Do not tell my dear mother that I am dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Tell her, brothers, that I am married,</div>
<div class="verse">That I have taken the tombstone for a mother-in-law, Black Earth for a wife,</div>
<div class="verse">And the fine grass blades all for brothers and sisters-in-law.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The maleficent deities are also responsible for floods. When
therefore, heavy floods threatened a village or a city in Gujarat,
the king or the headman used to go in procession to propitiate
the river with flowers, cocoanuts, and other offerings, so that
the floods should subside. Similarly, in the Punjab, when a
village is in danger of being flooded, the headman makes an
offering of a cocoanut and a rupee to the flood-demon. The
cocoanut represents the head of a human being and is believed
to be acceptable to the water-demon in lieu of a human victim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
The headman stands in the water and holds the offering in his
hand. When the flood rises high enough to wash the offering
from his hand, it is understood that the waters will abate.
Some people throw seven handfuls of boiled wheat and sugar
into the stream and distribute the remainder among the persons
present. Some take a male buffalo, a horse, or a ram, and after
boring the right ear of the victim, throw it into the water. If the
victim is a horse, it is saddled before it is offered.</p>

<p>In Bengal goats are sacrificed to propitiate the river-goddess
in her malignant form when she devastates the land with floods
or engulfs the swimmers. The goats are often thrown alive
into the water and are taken out by men of the boatman caste,
who eat their flesh. Many ascetics perform a special penance in
her honour, which consists in spending every night in the month
of January, when the cold is intense, seated on a small platform
erected over the river and engaged in such prayer and
meditation as their sufferings from the cold will allow.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Crooke
says that when the town and temples at Hardwar were in
imminent danger during the Gohna flood, the Brahmans poured
vessels of milk, rice and flowers into the waters of Mother
Ganges and prayed to her to spare them. Similarly, a story
is related in the Folklore Notes of Gujarat of the occurrence of
heavy floods in a village in the Jalalpur <i>taluka</i>, when a certain
lady placed an earthen vessel (ordinarily used for curdling
milk), containing <i>ghee</i>, afloat on the floods, whereupon the
waters were at once seen to recede.</p>

<p>A few years ago the river Musi overflowed and caused terrible
destruction. His Highness the Nizam thereupon went to the river,
took off his turban, and threw it into the water in the hope that such
submissiveness of a prince might appease the wrath of the river.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The calamity of floods should not, however, be exclusively
attributed to sheer demoniacal influence of malignant spirits.
It may, in some cases, be due to the offence given to patron saints
of water. Curtiss relates,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> on the authority of Rev. J. Steward
Crawford, an old resident in Syria, a remarkable incident which
occurred at Nebk. The town derives its water-supply from a
series of wells connected with one another. Once, owing to
heavy rains, there came a succession of three floods which
washed away the wells which had been repaired after each
catastrophe. This left no room for doubt that the <i>Vali</i> of the
wells had been offended. They began to ascertain the reason
and discovered that the sacrifices which had been offered to the
saint at an annual festival had been intermitted, that people
used to perform their ablutions in a portion of the stream which
was inside of the courtyard of the <i>mukam</i> (shrine), thus defiling
it, and that a dead body had been carried across the stream.
All this had angered the saint. Sacrifices were, therefore, offered
to propitiate him. A number of sheep were stationed over
the stream and their throats were cut so that the blood would
run into the water.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to turn from these river wraiths to the spirits
of the sea, who are more powerful but less exacting. A cocoanut
is enough to keep them in good humour, and a special day is
named for this offering, called <i>Narali Purnima</i>, or Cocoanut
Holiday. On that day multitudes of people flock to the sea-shore
in Bombay to offer their <i>puja</i> to the sea to keep it quiet
after the monsoon. The Brahmin first offers prayers, then the
votary throws into the sea the holy water which the Brahmin
pours into the hollow of his hands, then some red
lead, then a few flowers and some rice, and last of all the
cocoanut. The safety of the seas during the fair season is
thus insured.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHO WERE THE WATER DEMONS?</span></h3>

<p>Whence arose the fear of evil spirits? Who were those water
demons? Both philology and history confirm the view that
the <i>Devas</i> or demons of old were in many cases either the
conquered aborigines of the various lands in which the ancient
Aryans settled themselves, or hostile races dwelling along their
frontiers. Out of this hostility of races coming in close contact
with one another sprang various superstitions. In some cases
the armies of the aborigines were represented as accompanied
by their own guardian spirits, who waged war upon the newcomers
and who were therefore regarded as demoniacal. In
other cases, the aborigines were themselves credited with the
power of exercising demon functions or assuming demon forms.
Thus the people of Iran believed that the land of Turan was full
of demons. This influence of the conquered people did not die
out after the struggle with them was over. Not only did the
aborigines continue to believe in their own demoniacal powers
and to observe their old rites and customs in the new régime,
but they also spread the beliefs in many ways among their
conquerors.</p>

<p>All untoward occurrences and unusual natural phenomena
thus came to be attributed to the malignant action of those
evil spirits. Storms, floods, famines, disease and death all proceeded
from the <i>Devas</i>, who in the <i>Yasna Haptanhaiti</i> of the
Zoroastrians are described as “the wicked, bad, wrongful
originators of mischief, the most baneful, destructive and
basest of beings.” Professor Robertson Smith relegates
demonism to the position of a cult hostile to and separate
from the tribal beliefs of early people and Mr. Walhouse
points out<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> that these beliefs in demons “belong to the
Turanian races and are antagonistic to the Aryan genius and
feelings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt, Max Müller holds a different view. He considers
that there is no difficulty in tracing a belief in evil, unclean and
maleficent spirits, such as abound in Atharva-Veda, to the same
soil which produced a faith in good and beneficent spirits.
“We need not go for them,” says he, “to the original inhabitant
of India or the Blacks of Australia. Some of the great Vedic
gods like Rudra and the Maruts often assume a double aspect.
They are unkind as well as kind, they cause disease though
they likewise heal them. We have plenty of evil spirits in the
Veda, such as Vritras, Rakshasas, Yâmdhânas, Pisâkas. Of
course, nothing is easier than to say that they were borrowed from
the native races of India, but this, which was formerly a very
favourite expedient, would hardly commend itself now to any
serious scholar, excepting always the cases where Dravidian
words can actually be discovered in Sanscrit.”</p>

<p>These comments, however, merely contain a warning not
to stretch too widely a partial explanation of the origin of
evil spirits. The race-origin of the lesser malignant spirits may
not account for the existence of the Vedic giants and demons.
Neither has anyone attempted to do so. There is, however, no
doubt that several of the myths of <i>bhuts</i> and <i>dâkans</i>, giants and
dwarfs, are connected with traditions of hostile races. Folklore
throws considerable light on this question and a good deal of
evidence has been brought forward by Grimm and other
folklorists. Tylor has endorsed this evidence and the influence
of the hostility of races on the beliefs of people in
many lands is very skilfully examined by Sir Laurence Gomme
in a chapter entitled the “Mythic influence of a conquered
race” in his <i>Ethnology of Folklore</i>, and also in a chapter on
“Ethnological conditions” in his later work, <i>Folklore as an
Historical Science</i>. For our present purpose one or two examples
from Indian Folklore will suffice. On Bombay side, when a person
is possessed, generally the evil spirit is of a low caste, a Mahar,
or Bhanghi or a Mochi or a Pinjari. The <i>dâkans</i> (witches) who
haunt our wayside wells and trees and cemeteries also belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to such low castes, as Kolis, Vaghris and Charans. The mountain
ranges and jungle tracts of Southern India are still inhabited by
semi-savage tribes, who, there is good reason to believe, once held
the fertile open plains. As pointed out by Walhouse in the
<i>Journal of the Anthropological Society</i>, the contempt and loathing
in which they are ordinarily held, are curiously tinctured with
superstitious fear; for they are believed to possess secret powers
of magic and witchcraft and influence with the old malignant
deities of the soil who can direct good or evil fortune. To this
day the people of Chota Nagpur believe that the Moondahs
possess powers of sorcery and can transform themselves into
tigers and other beasts of prey with a view to devouring their
enemies. Similarly, the Kathodis are believed to transform
themselves into tigers. Many closely parallel beliefs can be
quoted from the history of demonism in the western world and
Sir Laurence Gomme points out that the general characteristics
of the superstitions brought about by the contact between the
Aryan conquerors of India and the non-Aryan aborigines are
also represented in the cult of European witchcraft. Underneath
the emblems of the foreign civilisation lie the traditional
custom and belief, “the attributes of the native
uncivilisation.”</p>

<p>A notable illustration is given by Evans Wentz in <i>Fairy Faith
in Celtic Countries</i>. The only true Cornish Fairy, says the
author, is the Piksy, of the race which is the <i>Pohel Vean</i> or
Little People, and the Spriggan is only one of his aspects. The
Piksy would seem to be the “Brownie” of the Lowland Scot,
the <i>Duine Sith</i> of the Highlanders, and if we may judge from
an interesting note in Scott’s <i>Pirate</i>, the “Peight” of the
Orkneys. If <i>Duine Sith</i> really means “the Folk of the Mounds
(burrows),” not the “People of Peace,” it is possible that there is
something in the theory that Brownie, <i>Duine Sith</i>, and “Peight,”
which is Pict, are only in their origin ways of expressing the little
dark-complexioned aboriginal folk who were supposed to inhabit
the burrows, cromlechs, and allées couvertes, and whose cunning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
their only effective weapon against the mere strength of the
Aryan invader, earned them a reputation for magical powers.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Let us now see how far this view of the case helps us in understanding
the Parsi beliefs in the Mahomedan guardian spirits of
wells, to which reference has already been made. The relations
of the Parsis with the Hindus and Mahomedans in the land of
their adoption were not exactly those of conquered aborigines
to the conquerors, but were, until the advent of the English,
practically the same as those of subject races to the rulers.
It was, however, no case of contact with a higher culture, rather
it was the case of assimilation of a ruder culture. No doubt, the
Parsis had taken to India from their ancient home a belief in
the existence of a presiding genius of water. That, however,
was a belief considerably different from that which in India
gave the water-spirits a local habitation and a name. But by
long contact with the Hindus and Mahomedans the community
came to believe in several local deities and absorbed several
local rituals. No doubt, the primary factor in inducing this
recognition and worship of local deities was the fear of their
power to do harm, but with it must also have been blended the
desire to please the neighbouring communities and the hope of
receiving favours at the hands of the spirits if properly adored
and propitiated.</p>

<p>This it was that seems to have led many a Parsi in the
mofussil to offer oil at the temple of <i>Hanuman</i> or to take
flowers to the shrines of Mahomedan saints, whose aid they
sought and who did not fail to appear to them, warning them and
directing them, mostly in dreams. When they went to Bombay
they had already absorbed the Hindu ideas concerning the
spirits lurking in or near deserted tanks and wells and regarded
them as the haunts of evil spirits such as <i>dâkans</i> and <i>sankhinis</i>,
<i>bhuts</i> and <i>prets</i>. When, however, they dug wells in their
own houses, in the absence of any well-spirit in the Zoroastrian
pantheon and in the absence of any Hindu guardian-spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of household wells, they appear to have invariably
peopled their private wells with <i>sayyids</i> and <i>pirs</i> in whose virtues
they had already come to believe and whom they had
already venerated at their shrines and whom it was thus
convenient for them to honour in their own houses by giving
them a <i>sthan</i> or <i>thanak</i> in their wells.</p>

<p>Thus we see that what was at first a purely Scriptural belief
in the sanctity of water and its presiding genius is now a
medley of many divergent elements owing to the fusion of
divers local traditions with the fundamental tribal belief during
the long intercourse of the community with the Hindus and Mahomedans.
There is no country in the world where people live
under more varied social and religious conditions and where
they are more exposed to the influence of neighbours than
in India and of all the cities of this cosmopolitan country there
is none more cosmopolitan than the city of Bombay.</p>

<p>Possibly, if we carry on local research in the Bombay Presidency
and try to localise the beliefs and customs concerning
well-worship, a good deal of fresh light may be thrown on
this question. The work is by no means very difficult and with
the aid of European folklorists, who have already shown us the
way, it should be easy to carry on research throughout India.
Sir Laurence Gomme, for instance, has given us in a luminous
chapter on the localisation of primitive beliefs, a very skilful
analysis of the different phases in which water-worship is still
found in the United Kingdom. All the survivals of this cult
he has allocated and explained by their ethnological bearing.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">ANALYSIS OF THE BRITISH CULTS.</span></h3>

<p>Commencing with the Teutonic centres of England, Sir
Laurence Gomme shows that the middle and south-eastern
counties almost fix the boundary of one form of well-worship, a
form which has lost all local colour, all distinct ritual, and
remains only in the dedication of the well or spring to a saint
of the Christian Church, in the tradition of its name as a
“holy well,” or else in the memory of some sort of reverence
formerly paid to the waters, which in many cases are
nameless. Proceeding from small beginnings where the survival
of the ancient cult is represented by the simple idea of
reverence for wells mostly dedicated to a Christian saint, he
takes us through stages where a ceremonial is faintly
traced in the well-dressing with garlands decked with flowers
and ribbons, where shrubs and trees growing near the well
are the recipients of offerings by devotees to the spirit of the
well, where disease and sickness of all kinds are ministered to,
where aid is sought against enemies, where the gift of rain is
obtained, where the spirits appear in general forms as fairies
and in specific form as animal or fish, and finally, it may be
in anthropomorphic form as Christian saints, where priestesses
attend the well to preside over the ceremonies. With the several
variants overlapping at every stage and thus keeping the whole
group of superstition and custom in touch, one section with
another, he shows that there is every reason to identify this
cult as the most widespread and the most lasting in connection
with local natural objects. He points out, moreover, that it
is in the Celtic-speaking districts where the rudest and most
uncivilised ceremonial is extant, and further, that it is in the
country of the Goidelic or earliest branch of the Celts, where
this finds its most pronounced types.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>To show how this may be translated into terms of ethnology
he has given us the following table showing where the survivals
of the cult are the most perfect, that is to say, less
touched by the incoming civilisations which have swept over
them:—</p>

<p>It may be gathered from this table that the acts of simple reverence,
garland-dressing, and dedication to a Christian saint are
to be taken as the late expressions in popular tradition of the
earlier and more primitive acts and practices tabulated above.
Taking the more primitive elements as the basis, the author
shows that the lowest point is obtained from English ground,
which only rises into the primitive stages in the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
counties where rag-bushes are found. On Welsh ground the
highest point of primitive culture is the tradition of an animal
guardian-spirit. On Irish ground the highest point is the
identification of the well deity with the rain-god, while on
Scottish ground the highest points recognisable elsewhere are
accentuated in degree.</p>

<p>The author also shows that garland-dressing, pins and rag-bushes,
the three forms in which offerings to the well-deities
are made, are but variants of one primitive form—namely, the
offerings of rags or parts of clothing upon bushes sacred to the
well. This species of offerings, according to a summary given
by General Pitt-Rivers, extends throughout Northern Africa
from west to east. Mungo Park mentions it in Western Africa;
Sir Samuel Baker speaks of it on the confines of Abyssinia, and
says that the people who practised it were unable to assign a
reason for doing so; Burton also found the same custom in
Arabia during his pilgrimage to Mecca; in Persia Sir William
Ouseley saw a tree close to a large monolith covered with these
rags, and he describes it as a practice appertaining to a religion
long since proscribed in that country; Colonel Leslie says that
in the Dekkan and Ceylon the trees in the neighbourhood of
wells may be seen covered with similar scraps of cotton; Dr. A.
Campbell speaks of it as being practised by the Limboos near
Darjeeling in the Himalayas, where it is associated, as in Ireland,
with large heaps of stones; and Huc in his travels mentions
it among the Tartars. We shall examine the ideas underlying
the practice of rag-offering in different countries in a separate
chapter. Meanwhile, the conclusion that Sir Laurence Gomme
draws from this summary may be noted in his own words:—</p>

<p>“Here not only do we get evidence of the cult in an Aryan
country like Persia being proscribed, but, as General Pitt-Rivers
observes, ‘it is impossible to believe that so singular
a custom as this, invariably associated with cairns, megalithic
monuments, holy wells, or some such early Pagan institutions,
could have arisen independently in all these countries.’ That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the area over which it is found is coterminous with the area
of the megalithic monuments, that these monuments take us
back to pre-Aryan people and suggest the spread of this people
over the area covered by their remains, are arguments in favour
of a megalithic date for well-worship and rag-offerings.”</p>

<p>This ramble of ours through many ages and many lands in
search of evidence of water-worship may now be brought
to a close. Let us now witness the ceremonies connected
with the digging of wells and the different customs of
decorating wells and the varied offerings proffered to the
nymphs and spirits residing in the waters. With the picture
that will be thus presented of Indian wells decked with
<i>jalis</i> (trellis work) of flowers and illumined with <i>ghee</i>-lamps,
their pavements strewn with cocoanuts, sugar and sweets and
milk and <i>ghee</i>, and smeared with red lead in lieu of blood, but
daubed also in some places with the blood of animal-sacrifice,
it will be interesting to contrast the picture of English wells
fantastically tapestried about with old rags and practically
unlit and unembellished, save for a little garland-dressing here
and there, and filled with pins and needles, buttons and coins.</p>

<span class="smaller">WATER-DIVINING AND WELL-OPENING CEREMONIES.</span></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Spring up, O well,</div>
<div class="verse">Sing ye to it:</div>
<div class="verse">Thou well dug by princes,</div>
<div class="verse">Sunk by the nobles of the people,</div>
<div class="verse">With the sceptre, with their staves</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the desert a gift.”</div>

<p>This beautiful song of the well is taken from the Jewish scriptures.
Budde believes that the song alludes to a custom by
which when a well or spring was found, it was lightly covered
over, and then opened by the Sheikhs in the presence of the
clan and to the accompaniment of a song. In this way, by
the fiction of having dug it, the well was regarded as the property
of the clan. He thinks that a passage in Nilus (Migne,
“Patrologia Graeca”), to which Goldziber has called attention,
confirms this view. Nilus says that when the nomadic Arabs
found a well they danced by it and sang songs to it. According
to Kazivini when the water of the wells of Ilabistan failed, a
feast was held at the source, with music and dancing, to induce
it to flow again.</p>

<p>In India when a well is to be dug, an expert is first called to
select a favourable site. To some experts such sites are revealed
in dreams. Some possess the faculty of hearing the sound of
water running underneath, others point out the sites by smelling
out sweet water underground. The <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i> bears
testimony to the wonderful faculties of these experts. “Sites
for wells,” says the writer,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> “are chosen with great success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
by water-diviners, or <i>pánikals</i>, whose services can be engaged
at the rate of Re. 1-4 a well. Their judgment is unerring and
many instances are on record of their practical ability. They
can also generally tell at what depth the spring will be
tapped.”</p>

<p>The sniffers are known as Bhonyesunghna in Gujarat and
Cutch, and as Sunga in the Punjab, and they generally belong
to a class of <i>Faqirs</i> gifted with this faculty. The Luniyas, a
caste of navvies, are also endowed with these powers. In the
Punjab a herd of goats is driven about in search of sites of
deserted wells. When these goats arrive at the right spot, they
lie down and that is a signal for a search.</p>

<p>Water-diviners are not unknown in the West. One of
the extraordinary incidents of the recent Gallipoli campaign
was the discovery of water by a Kentish water-diviner
at Suvla Bay. During the critical hours which followed the
landing at the place in August 1915, the great problem for the
officers was to find water on that parched land. The experts had
examined the district and reported that there was no water to
be got there, but Sapper Stephen Kelly, of the 3rd Australian
Light Horse Brigade, a hydraulic engineer of Melbourne, possessed
the gift for water-divining. While he was standing with Captain
Shearen, a New Zealand Officer, in the line of communications,
he cried out, “There’s water here where we’re standing.”
News of his reputation had reached Brigadier-General Hughes,
who sent for him immediately and asked him if he could find
water. The Sapper was confident of finding it. The Brigadier
gave him a sporting chance and put a thousand men under his
direction. Within a few hours he opened up a well which
had been sunk. In a little more time he had thirty wells going
with sufficient water to supply every man with a gallon a day
and every mule with its six gallons, and this of pure cold spring
water “instead of the lukewarm liquor from kerosene tins off
the transport.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The army’s engineers were astonished by Sapper Kelly’s
success, especially as he was without paper plans. When they
asked him about it, he replied that it would take him about half
the time to get the wells going that it would to draw up
the plans. Sapper Kelly was a Kent man, born in Maidstone.
He went out to Queensland when a small boy. At that time an
old water-diviner arrived in the neighbourhood and tried his
art in that locality. The boy trotted after the old man in his
twistings and turnings about the paddock with a divining twig
in his hand and when the old man found water, the boy “felt
his nerves twitch and a thrill go through him that wasn’t just
excitement.” He thought he would try too, and he did. From
that moment he had practised his powers. At Suvla, he said,
he got better results with a copper rod instead of the divining
twig.</p>

<p>We are not aware of any ceremonies connected with the
digging of wells in the West, but in India it is regarded as a
very important function requiring care and caution and, above
all, propitiation of the deities. A Brahmin is consulted as to
the auspicious hour when the work of digging should commence.
The auspicious days vary in different places. In Gujarat,
Tuesdays and the days on which the earth sleeps are avoided;
and the earth is supposed to be asleep on the 1st, the 7th, the
9th, the 10th, the 14th and the 24th days following a <i>Sankranti</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, the day on which the sun crosses from one constellation to
another. With the exception of these days, a date is generally
selected on which the <i>chandra-graha</i>, or the moon, is favourable
to the constructor of the well.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, the water diviner, the constructor of
the well, the Brahmin priest, and the labourers go to the place
where the well is to be dug, and an image of the god <i>Ganpati</i>, the
protector of all auspicious ceremonies, is first installed on the
spot and worshipped with <i>panchamrit</i>, a punch or mixture of
milk, curds, ghee, honey and sugar. A green-coloured piece of
<i>atlas</i> (silk cloth), about two feet long, is then spread on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
spot, and a pound and a quarter of wheat, a cocoanut, betels,
dates and copper coins are placed on it. A copper bowl filled
with water and containing some silver or gold coins is also placed
there. The mouth of the bowl is covered with the leaves of the
mango tree and a cocoanut is placed over the leaves. After
this the priest chants sacred hymns and asks his host to
perform the <i>Khat</i> ceremonies.</p>

<p>These Khat-muhurt or Khat-puja must be performed
before commencing the construction not only of wells,
reservoirs and tanks, but also of all works above or
under the ground, such as setting the <i>nankestambha</i>, or
the first pillar of a marriage bower, or a bower for a thread ceremony,
or laying the foundation-stone of a house or temple,
or a sacrificial pit, or of a street, or fortress, or a city or a village.
The earth-mother is then worshipped in the manner prescribed
in the <i>shashtras</i> to propitiate her against interruptions in the
completion of the work undertaken. The owner or the person
interested in the new work pours a little water on the earth where
the foundation-pit is to be dug, sprinkles red lead and <i>gulal</i> (red
powder), places a betel-nut and a few precious coins, and digs
out the first clod of earth himself. Rich persons use silver or
golden spades and hoes when turning up the first clod. Among
the usual offerings to <i>Ganpati</i> and to the earth on the occasion
are curd, milk, honey, molasses, cocoanuts, dhana (a kind of
spices), leaves of nagarval (a kind of creeper) and red lead. The
expert who is called to choose a proper site for the well offers
frankincense and a cocoanut to the spot, and lights a lamp
thereon. After the <i>Khat</i> ceremonies are over, the host distributes
sugar or molasses among those present and offers money
to the expert who generally refuses to accept it and asks the
host to dispose of it in charity. Even those who accept money
give away a part of it in alms to the poor.</p>

<p>Occasionally, with a view to securing unobstructed completion
of the work, the god <i>Ganpati</i> and the goddess <i>Jaladevi</i>
are installed and worshipped daily, until water appears in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
well. Some people, however, install the goddess <i>Jaladevi</i> after
the appearance of water, when a stone is taken out from the
bottom of the well and is plastered with red lead to represent
the goddess and is ceremoniously worshipped. When the construction
of the well is complete, a ceremony called <i>Vastu</i> or <i>jalostsana</i>
or water-festival is celebrated, Brahmins are entertained
at a feast and <i>dakshina</i> is given.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In the Punjab, the work of digging a well should begin on Sunday.
On the previous Saturday night little bowls of water
are placed round the proposed site, and the one which dries up
the least marks the best site for the well. The circumference is
then marked and the work of digging commenced, the central
lump of earth being left intact. This clod of earth is cut out
last and it is called <i>Khwajaji</i>, after Khwaja Khizr, the water-saint,
and is worshipped. If it breaks, it is a bad omen, and a
new site is selected a week later.</p>

<p>In the north-east a Pandit fixes the auspicious moment for
sinking a well. The owner then worships Gauri, Ganesha,
Shesha Naga, the world-serpent, the earth, the spade and the
nine planets. Then facing in the direction in which, according
to the directions of the Pandit, Shesha Naga is supposed to be
lying at the time, he cuts five clods with the spade. When the
workmen reach the point at which the wooden well-cush has to
be fixed, the owner smears the cush in five places with red powder
and tying dub-grass and a sacred thread to it, lowers it into its
place. A fire sacrifice is then offered, and Brahmins are fed.
When the well is ready, cow-dung, cow urine, milk, butter and
Ganges water, leaves of sacred Tulsi and honey are thrown into
the water before it is used. In the Konkan a golden cow is
thrown into a newly built well as an offering to the water
deities.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But, according to Crookes, no well is considered lucky until
the Salagrama, or the spiral ammonite sacred to Vishnu, is
solemnly wedded to the Tulsi or basil plant, representing the
garden or field which the well is intended to water. The rite
is performed according to the standard marriage formula: the
relations are assembled; the owner of the garden represents the
bridegroom, while a kinsman or his wife stands for the bride.
Gifts are given to Brahmins, a feast is held in the garden, and
both the garden and the well may then be used without any
danger.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">DECORATIONS AND OFFERINGS.</span></h3>

<p>We have seen that the Indian method of venerating a well
was to crown it with flowers, to cover it with <i>jalis</i> or trellis
work of flowers, to illumine it with ghee-lamps placed in
niches specially made for the purpose and to strew the pavement
with cocoanuts, betel-nuts, sugar and sweets and milk
and ghee and to smear it with red lead. We have also noticed
that floral decoration and garland-dressing is an act of simple
reverence, being a survival of the earlier and more primitive
practices and ceremonials. The other offerings, however, particularly
cocoanut, and the practice of smearing the pavement
with red lead point to beliefs associating spirits with water, and
these are survivals of the ancient cult of human and animal
sacrifices offered to the water-spirit. The cocoanut, resembling
a human head, is accepted by the spirits, in lieu of a human
being, similarly red lead does duty for the blood of animal victims.
The Germans hoodwink the water-spirit with another curious
substitute and that is a loaf of bread. It is the practice to throw
a loaf into the water at Rotenburg on the Neckar. If this offering
is not given, the river-spirit would take away a man.
The practice of placing lamps inside the well also points to
spirit-beliefs. The lights, it is hoped, would scare away evil
spirits from the water.</p>

<p>There is enough anthropological evidence to show that at one
time human sacrifices were offered in east and west alike to
the spirits of fire, earth and water. Numerous authorities may
be cited. The Indian practices are well known. For continental
examples we may select only one from Sir James Frazer’s
<i>Golden Bough</i> concerning the practice of burning humans beings
in the fires. The most unequivocal traces of human sacrifices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
offered on these occasions are those which, about a hundred
years ago, still lingered at the Beltane fires in the Highlands
of Scotland, that is, among a Celtic people who, situated in a
remote corner of Europe and almost completely isolated from
foreign influence, had till then conserved their old heathenism
better than any other people in the west of Europe. “It is significant,”
says Sir James Frazer, “that human sacrifices by fire
are known, on unquestionable evidence, to have been systematically
practised by the Celts. The earliest description of these
sacrifices has been bequeathed to us by Julius Cæsar. As conqueror
of the hitherto independent Celts of Gaul, Cæsar had
ample opportunity of observing the national Celtic religion and
manners, while these were still fresh and crisp from the native
mint and had not yet been fused in the melting-pot of Roman
civilization.... The following seem to have been the main
outlines of the custom. Condemned criminals were reserved by
the Celts in order to be sacrificed to the gods at a great festival
which took place once in every five years. The more there were
of such victims, the greater was believed to be the fertility of
the land. If there were not enough criminals to furnish victims,
captives taken in war were immolated to supply the deficiency.
When the time came, the victims were sacrificed by the Druids
or priests, some they shot down with arrows, some they impaled,
and some they burned alive in the following manner. Colossal
images of wicker-work or of wood and grass were constructed;
these were filled with live men, cattle and animals of other kinds;
fire was then applied to the images, and they were burned with
their living contents. Such were the great festivals held once
every five years. But besides these quinquennial festivals,
celebrated on so grand a scale and with, apparently, so large an
expenditure of human life, it seems reasonable to suppose that
festivals of the same sort, only on a lesser scale, were held annually,
and that from these annual festivals are lineally descended some
at least of the fire-festivals which, with their traces of human
sacrifices, are still celebrated year by year in many parts of
Europe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, in pagan Europe water claimed its human victims
on Midsummer Day. We have already seen that in England
the spirits of the River Tees, the Skerne and the Ribble, the
Spey and the Dee demand human victims. We have also seen
how the river sprites in Germany transcend the rest of the
spirits in Europe in their blood-thirstiness. We also learn from
Tacitus that the ancient Germans offered human sacrifices. He
tells us that the image of the goddess Nerthus, her vestments
and chariot were washed in a certain lake, and that immediately
afterwards the slaves who ministered to the goddess were swallowed
by the lake. The statement may perhaps be understood
to mean that the slaves were drowned as a sacrifice to the
deity.</p>

<p>The next stage was that of animal sacrifices. It is well known
that just as goats and buffaloes were sacrificed in India, so were
bulls and calves offered to the deities in Europe. In Bombay
cocks and goats are still offered to water. The wells on the
continent, however, seldom receive animal offerings in these
days. Only in one case, namely in the case of St. Tegla’s Well,
which is resorted to for the cure of epilepsy, we find the patient
offering a cock or a hen. The usual offerings at other wells
are rags and ribbons, pins and needles, nails and shells, buttons
and coins, and sometimes bread and cheese. It will, therefore,
be news to many that in Great Britain the lamb was the votive
offering for water. Sir Laurence Gomme refers to this offering
in a chapter on ethnic elements in custom and ritual, in which
he compares certain ceremonies prevalent in India and Greece
and other parts of Europe and argues from the strong line of
parallel between the Indian ceremonies and those still observed
in Europe as survivals of a forgotten and unrecognised cult that
ceremonies which are demonstrably non-Aryan in India, even
in the presence of Aryan people, must in original have been
non-Aryan in Europe, though the race from whom they have
descended is not at present identified by ethnologists. One of
the customs selected by him for comparison is the Whitsuntide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
custom in the parish of King’s Teignton, Devonshire. Here is
a description of that custom:—</p>

<p>“A lamb is drawn about the parish on Whitsun Monday in a
cart covered with garlands of lilac, laburnum, and other flowers,
when persons are requested to give something towards the animal
and attendant expenses; on Tuesday it is then killed and roasted
whole in the middle of the village. The lamb is then sold in
slices to the poor at a cheap rate.”</p>

<p>The origin of the custom is forgotten, but a tradition, supposed
to trace back to heathen days, is to this effect: The village suffered
from a dearth of water, when the inhabitants were advised
by their priests to pray to the gods for water; whereupon the
water sprang up spontaneously in a meadow about a third of a
mile above the river, in an estate now called Rydon, amply
sufficient to supply the wants of the place, and at present adequate,
even in a dry summer, to work three mills. A lamb, it
is said, has ever since that time been sacrificed as a votive thank-offering
at Whitsuntide in the manner above mentioned.</p>

<p>The same ceremony, in a more primitive form, was observed
at the village of Holne. On May-morning, before daybreak,
the young men of the village used to assemble at a granite pillar
in the centre of a field called the Ploy Field. They then proceeded
to the moor, where they selected a ram lamb, and after running
it down brought it in triumph to the Ploy Field, fastened it to
the pillar, cut its throat, and then roasted it whole, skin, wool,
etc. At Midday a struggle took place, at the risk of cut hands,
for a slice, it being supposed to confer luck for the ensuing year
on the fortunate devourer. As an act of gallantry the young
men sometimes fought their way through the crowd to get a
slice for the chosen amongst the young women, all of whom, in
their best dresses, attended the Ram Feast as it was called.</p>

<p>In one of his odes Horace made a solemn promise that
he would make a present of a very fine kid, some sweet
wine and flowers to a noble fountain in his own Sabine Villa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
We have seen that even to-day the Parsis offer goats and fowl
to the spirits of the well. The process of reasoning is the same.
The Gujarati Hindu, however, shrinks from such slaughter.
Nevertheless, the gods have to be propitiated. He therefore offers
acceptable substitutes for animal victims, such as cocoanuts and
red lead. Betelnuts, sugar and milk and ghee likewise keep the
spirits in good humour.</p>

<p>Offerings of coins to the well-spirits are common in the East
as in the West. What can be the explanation? Is the coin
offered as a price for the boon that one expects to derive from the
healing powers of the wells? That at any rate is the idea prompting
the man bitten by a rabid dog when he goes to a well inhabited
by a Vâchharo, with two earthen cups filled with milk and
with a pice in each, which he empties into the water. But
quite a different and curious explanation of the offering is found in
the <i>Folklore Notes of Gujarat</i>. “It is a belief among Hindus,”
says one of the informants of the late Mr. Jackson, “that to give
alms in secret confers a great boon on the donor. Some of the
orthodox people, therefore, throw pice into wells, considering it
to be a kind of secret charity.”</p>

<span class="smaller">RAG WELLS AND PIN WELLS.</span></h3>

<p>The most singular feature of well-worship in Europe is the
fantastic custom of offering rags at sacred wells, also pins and
buttons, rusty nails and needles, and even shells and pebbles.
Rag wells and pin wells abound in Great Britain and Ireland.
Many references to these are found in the works of European
folklorists. Sir Laurence Gomme has skilfully distributed
them geographically and we may adopt his analysis.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In the
middle and southern countries of England these practices have
not survived, but in northern England one comes across several
pin-wells. At Sefton in Lancashire it was customary for
passers-by to drop into St. Helen’s well a new pin for good
luck or to secure the fulfilment of an expressed wish and by
the turning of the pin-point to the north or to any other point
of the compass conclusions were drawn as to the fidelity of
lovers, date of marriage and other love matters. At Brindle is
a well dedicated to St. Ellin, where on Patron day pins are
thrown into the water. Such pin-wells also existed at Jarrow
and Wooler in Northumberland, at Breyton Minchmore, Koyingham,
and Mount Grace in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>At Great Cotes and Winterton in Lincolnshire, Newcastle and
Benton in Northumberland, Newton Kyme, Thorp Arch, and
Gargrave in Yorkshire, pieces of rag, cloth, or ribbon take the
place of the pins, and are tied to bushes adjoining the wells,
while near Newton, at the foot of Roseberry Topping, the shirt
or shift of the devotee was thrown into the well, and according
as it floated or sank so would the sickness leave or be fatal, while
as an offering to the saint a rag of the shirt is torn off and left
hanging on the briars thereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Pin wells in Wales are met with at Rhosgoch in Montgomeryshire,
St. Cynhafal’s Well in Denbighshire, St. Barruc’s Well on
Barry Island, near Cardiff, Ffynon Gwynwy spring in Carnarvonshire,
and a well near Penrhos. Reference has already been
made to the cursing well of St. Aelian. Anyone who wished
to inflict a curse upon an enemy resorted to the priestess of
the well and got the name of the person proposed to be cursed
registered in a book kept for the purpose. A pin was then dropped
into the well in the name of the victim, and the curse was
complete. Pin-wells and rag-wells are both represented in Cornwall
as, for instance, at Pelynt, St. Austel and St. Roche, where
pins are offered, and at Madron Well, where both pins and rags
are offered.</p>

<p>In Ireland the offering of rags is a universal custom. Among
examples of rag-wells may be mentioned Ardclinis, County Antrim;
Errigall-Keroge, County Tyrone; Dungiven, St. Bartholomew’s
Well at Pilltown, County Waterford; and St. Brigid’s
Well at Cliffony, County Sligo.</p>

<p>About fifty years after the Reformation it was noted that the
wells of Scotland were all “tapestried about with old rags.”
The best examples lasting to within modern times are to be found
in the islands round the coast and in the northern shires, particularly
in Banff, Aberdeen, Perth, Ross, and Caithness. At
Kilmuir, in the Isle of Skye, at Loch Hiant, or Siant, there was
“a shelf made in the wall of a contiguous enclosure” for placing
thereon “the offerings of small rags, pins, and coloured threads
to the divinity of the place.” At St. Mourie’s Well, on Malruba
Isle, a rag was left on the bushes, nails stuck into an oak tree,
or sometimes a copper coin driven in. At Toubirmore Well, in
Gigha Isle, devotees were accustomed to leave “a piece of money,
a needle, pin, or one of the prettiest variegated stones they
could find,” and at Tonbir Well, in Jura, they left “an offering
of some small token, such as a pin, needle, farthing or the
like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>In Banffshire, at Montblairie, “many still alive remember
to have seen the impending boughs adorned with rags of linen
and woollen garments, and the well enriched with farthings and
bodles, the offerings of those who came from afar to the fountain.”
At Keith the well is near a stone circle, and some
offering was always left by the devotees. In Aberdeenshire,
at Frazerburgh, “the superstitious practice of leaving some
small trifle” existed. In Perthshire at St. Fillan’s Well,
Comrie, the patients leave behind “some rags of linen or woollen
cloth.” In Caithness, at Dunnat, they throw a piece of money
into the water, and at Wick they leave a piece of bread and cheese
and a silver coin, which they alleged disappeared in some mysterious
way. In Ross and Cromarty, at Alness, “pieces of coloured
cloth were left as offerings”; at Cragnick an offering of
a rag was suspended from a bramble bush overhanging the well;
at Fodderty the devotees “always left on a neighbouring bush
or tree a bit of coloured cloth or thread as a relic”; and at Kiltearn
shreds of clothing were hung on the surrounding trees. In
Sutherlandshire, at Farr and at Loth, a coin was thrown into
the well. In Dumfriesshire, at Penpont, a part of the dress was
left as an offering, and many pieces have been seen “floating on
the lake or scattered round the banks.” In Kirkcudbrightshire
at Buittle, “either money or clothes” was left, and in Renfrewshire,
at Houston, “pieces of cloth were left as a present or
offering to the saint on the bushes.”</p>

<p>Macaulay in his History of St. Kilda, speaking of a consecrated
well in that island called Tobirnimbuadh, or the spring of
divers virtues, says: “Near the fountain stood an altar,
on which the distressed votaries laid down their oblations.
Before they could touch sacred water with any prospect of
success, it was their constant practice to address the Genius
of the place with supplication and prayers. No one approached
him with empty hands. But the devotees were abundantly
frugal. The offerings presented by them were the poorest
acknowledgments that could be made to a superior being, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
whom they had either hopes or fears, shells and pebbles, rags
of linen or stuffs worn out, pins, needles, or rusty nails, were
generally all the tribute that was paid; and sometimes, though
rarely enough, copper coins of the smallest value.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>What may be the ideas underlying these singular gifts?</p>

<p>Henderson explains in <i>Folklore</i> that “the country girls
imagine that the well is in charge of a fairy or spirit who must
be propitiated by some offering, and the pin presents itself as the
most ready or convenient, besides having a special suitableness
as being made of metal.” Miss Marian Cox in her <i>Introduction
to Folklore</i> says that the pins, coins, buttons and other objects
found in wells, and generally considered to be offerings, may
formerly have been vehicles of the diseases which patients have
thought thus to throw off. This suggestion is probably based on
the theory put forward by Sir John Rhys in regard to the rag-offerings
at sacred wells. He believed that the object of placing
these scraps of clothing at the wells was for transferring the
disease from the sick person to some one else. The same
explanation is vouchsafed in regard to the Indian custom
of hoisting flags on trees. But whether or not this explanation
is partially true in regard to the rag offerings, it is
evidently untenable in regard to the presents of pins and
buttons which are unquestionably offerings intended to please
the well spirits.</p>

<p>In combating the opinion of Sir John Rhys, Sir Laurence
Gomme gives in <i>Folklore as an Historical Science</i> a very
significant example. “Among other items,” says he, “I
have come across an account of an Irish station, as it is called,
at a sacred well, the details of which fully bear out my view
as to the nature of the rags deposited at the shrine being
offerings to the local deity. One of the devotees, in true Irish
fashion, made his offering accompanied by the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
words:—‘To St. Columbkill—I offer up this button, a bit o’ the
waistband o’ my own breeches, an’ a taste o’ my wife’s petticoat,
in remimbrance of us havin’ made this holy station; an’ may
they rise up in glory to prove it for us in the last day.’”</p>

<p>“I shall not attempt,” says the author, “to account for the
presence of the usual Irish humour in this, to the devotee, most
solemn offering; but I point out the undoubted nature of the
offerings and their service in the identification of their owners—a
service which implies their power to bear witness in spirit-land
to the pilgrimage of those who deposited them during lifetime
at the sacred well.” Mr. Eden Phillpots in one of his Cornish
stories, <i>Lying Prophets</i>, confirms this view. In that story rags
are offered. “Just a rag tored off a petticoat or some such
thing. They hanged ’em up round about on the thorn bushes,
to show as they’d a’done more for the good saint if they’d
had the power.”</p>

<p>A few more authorities may be cited. These have been
referred to in Knowlson’s <i>Origins of Popular Superstitions and
Customs</i>. Grose explains the custom in the following extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Between the towns of Alten and Newton, near the
foot of the Rosberrye Toppinge, there is a well dedicated
to St. Oswald. The neighbours have an opinion that a
shirt or shift, taken off a sick person and thrown into that
well, will show whether the person will recover or die; for
if it floated, it denoted the recovery of the party; if it
sunk, there remained no hope of their life; and to reward
the saint for his intelligence, <i>they tear off a rag of the shirt,
and leave it hanging on the briers thereabouts</i> where,
‘I have seen such numbers as might have made a
fayre rheme in a paper-myll’.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is an echo of this theory in the <i>Statistical Account of
Scotland</i>: “A spring in the Moss of Melshach, of the chalybeats
kind, is still in reputation among the common people. Its
sanative qualities extend even to brutes. As this spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
probably obtained vogue at first in days of ignorance and superstition,
it would appear that it became customary to leave
at the well <i>part of the clothes of the sick and diseased</i> and harness
of the cattle as an offering of gratitude to the divinity who
bestowed healing virtues on its waters. And now, even though
the superstitious principle no longer exists, the accustomed
offerings are still presented.”</p>

<p>Here is one more extract from the Statistical Account of
Scotland:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is at Balmano a fine spring well, called St.
John’s Well, which in ancient times was held in great
estimation. Numbers, who thought its waters of a sanative
quality, brought their rickety children to be washed
in its stream. Its water was likewise thought a sovereign
remedy for sore eyes, which, by frequent washing, was
supposed to cure them. To show their gratitude to the
saint, and that he might be propitious to continue the
virtues of the waters, they put into the well presents, not
indeed of any great value, or such as would have been of
the least service to him if he had stood in need of
money, but such as they conceived the good and merciful
apostle, who did not delight in costly oblations, could not
fail to accept. The presents generally given were pins,
needles, and rags taken from their clothes.”</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Rhys himself suggests that a distinction is to be
drawn between the rags hung on trees or near a well and the
pins, which are so commonly thrown into the water itself. In
his opinion only the rags were meant to be vehicles of disease.
“If this opinion were correct”, says Hartland, “one would expect
to find both ceremonies performed by the same patient at the
same well; he would throw in the pin and also place the rag on the
bush, or wherever its proper place might be. The performance
of both ceremonies, is, however, I think, exceptional. Where
the pin or button is dropped into the well, the patient does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
trouble about the rag, and <i>vice versa</i>.” Hartland is therefore
inclined to think that the rags stand for entire articles of clothing
which used to be deposited at an earlier time and he thinks that
on the analogy of the part representing the whole the rags were
intended to connect the worshipper with the deity. The reasoning
underlying the rag-offerings, then, resolves itself into the
following simple syllogism: My shirt or stocking, or a rag to
represent it, stands for me; being placed upon a sacred bush
or thrust into a sacred well it is in constant contact with
divinity; the effluence of divinity, reaching and involving it
therefore reaches and involves me.</p>

<p>A curious detail in regard to these rag-offerings is given by Mrs.
Evans in reference to the rags tied on the bushes at St. Elian’s
well. These rags must be tied with wool. This detail is not
mentioned by the various authorities whom we have referred to,
and the reason for using wool remains to be explained. We
know that with the Hindus as well as with the Parsis the sheep
is a sacred animal. The use of woollen clothes is prescribed in
certain Hindu rituals and the sacred thread of the Parsis, which
he carries round his waist day and night, is made of sheep’s
wool. Probably the same idea led to the use of wool in the
English custom of hanging up rags. If so, it affords a further
ground for concluding that the rag was not a mere vehicle of
disease but a grateful offering devoutly presented to the deity of
the well or the tree.</p>

<p>Macedonian folklore furnishes further evidence in this behalf.
Travellers in Macedonia often see newly-built fountains decorated
with cotton or wool threads of many colours. These
threads are torn by wayfarers from their dress on beholding
the fountain for the first time. “They alight and after having
slaked their thirst in the waters of the fountain, leave these
offerings as tokens of gratitude to the presiding nymph.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">A MISUNDERSTOOD INDIAN CUSTOM.</span></h3>

<p>In India no one would think of offering to the water-spirits
such impure articles as pins and needles and nails, much less
“rags tored off shirts and petticoats.” It would be positive
defilement of water. Sometimes, however, flags are seen hoisted
near holy wells, and European travellers represent them as
rag wells corresponding to those with which they are familiar in
the west. There is, however, a good deal of difference between
the two customs. In the first place these flags are not rags.
They are made of new, unused cloth. It is a universal custom in
India to put up <i>dhajas</i> or standards near shrines, sepulchres
and sacred trees believed to harbour spirits. When there is
such a shrine or tree near a well, a flag is hoisted at the spot.
But it is done in honour, not of the water-spirit, but of the god or
goddess installed in the shrine or of the spirit dwelling in the
tree or of the saint buried in the vicinity. I have made
personal enquiries and consulted authorities in search of
evidence for rag wells in India, but have not come across any
single instance. True, Crooke in his <i>Popular Religion and
Folklore of Northern India</i>, makes the rather sweeping assertion
that India supplies numerous examples of the custom of
hanging up rags on trees or near sacred wells. Mention is also
made in the <i>Folklore Notes of Gujarat</i> of flags that are sometimes
hoisted near holy wells “in honour of the water-goddess
Jaldevki.” European folklorists are thereby led to docket these
as illustrations of the prevalence of the cult of rag wells in
India. But there is no evidence to show that rags are offered
to wells. These authors are often misled by the incomplete
data that they receive from their informants and in the
absence of full particulars any such incident as a flag hoisted near
a well is put forward as an example indicating the prevalence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a custom altogether foreign to the conceptions and even repugnant
to the sentiments of the Indian population.</p>

<p>No one mentions flags, all the folklorists talk of rags. Perhaps,
there is an excuse for it, as the new flags, no doubt, get
soiled in course of time. But, as pointed out above, it should
not have been overlooked that a regular standard is invariably
put up in honour of the presiding deity. It has no suggestion
for disease-transference. All deities, whatever their specific
virtues, get this honour without exception. The question,
then, for consideration is, does the same idea of reverence
account for the flags hoisted on trees? There is no doubt that
the primary idea was the same, although in process of time
superstitious people came to think that that was an offering
demanded by the spirits living in the trees and that if the offering
was not given, calamities would befall, particularly illness.
For instance, one of these spirits is known by the name of
<i>Chitharia</i> or <i>Ragged Pir</i>. He is supposed to dwell in such trees
as the Khijado, <i>i.e.</i>, Shami (Prosopis Spicigera) and Bawal, <i>i.e.</i>,
Babhul (Acacia Arabica). It is a common belief that if a
mother fails to offer a flag to such a holy tree while passing by it,
her children’s health and life are jeopardised. According to
another belief, travellers, in order to accomplish their journey
safely, offer flags to the trees reputed to be the dwelling-places of
spirits, if they happen to come across them during the journey.</p>

<p>In the <i>Folklore Notes of Gujarat</i> several interesting examples
of these beliefs and practices have been given and these may
be transcribed here in the compiler’s own words:—</p>

<p>“Some believe that both male and female spirits reside in
the <i>Khijado</i>, <i>Bāval</i> and <i>Kerado</i> trees and throw rags over them
with the object of preventing passers-by from cutting or removing
the trees. Some pile stones round their stems and draw
tridents over them with red lead and oil. If superstitious people
come across such trees, they throw pieces of stones on the
piles, believing them to be holy places, and think that by doing
so they attain the merit of building a temple or shrine. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
belief runs that this pile should grow larger and larger day by day,
and not be diminished. If the base of such a tree is not marked
by a pile of stones, rags only are offered; and if rags are not
available, the devotee tears off a piece of his garment, however
costly it may be, and dedicates it to the tree.</p>

<p>“Once a child saw its mother offering a rag to such a tree,
and asked her the reason of the offering. The mother replied
that her brother, that is the child’s maternal uncle, dwelt in the
tree. Hence a belief arose that a <i>chithario</i> (ragged) uncle
dwells in such trees. Others assert that the <i>chithario pir</i> dwells
in such trees, and they propitiate him by offering cocoanuts
and burning frankincense before it.</p>

<p>“There is a <i>Khijado</i> tree near Sultanpur which is believed to
be the residence of a demon <i>māmo</i>. This demon is propitiated
by the offerings of rags.</p>

<p>“Some declare that travellers fix rags of worn-out clothes to
the trees mentioned above in order that they may not be attacked
by the evil spirits residing in them. Another belief is that
the spirits of deceased ancestors residing in such trees get absolution
through this form of devotion. It is also believed that a
goddess called <i>chitharia devi</i> resides in such trees, and being
pleased with these offerings, blesses childless females with children,
and cures persons suffering from itch of their disease.
There is a further belief that ragged travellers, by offering pieces
of their clothes to the <i>Khijado</i>, <i>Bāval</i> or <i>Kerado</i> trees, are blessed
in return with good clothes.</p>

<p>“Some believe that Hanumān, the lord of spirits, resides in
certain trees. They call him <i>chithario</i> or ragged Hanumān. All
passers-by offer rags to the trees inhabited by him. There is
such a tree near the station of Shirei. There is a tamarind tree
on the road from Tamnagar to Khantalia which is believed to be
the residence of <i>chithario</i> Hanumān and receives similar offerings.
Another tamarind tree of this description is near Marad
and there is a <i>Khijado</i> tree on the road between Kalavad and
Vavadi which is similarly treated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is related by some people that in deserts trees are rare
and the summer heat is oppressive. To the travellers passing
through such deserts the only place of rest is in the shadow of a
solitary tree that is to be met occasionally. In order that no
harm be done to such trees, some people have given currency
to the belief that a spirit called <i>māmo</i> dwells in such trees and
expects the offering of a rag and a pice at the hands of every
passer-by.</p>

<p>“In some places, the <i>Borādi</i> (jujube,) <i>Pipal</i>, <i>Vad</i> (banyan)
and the sweet basil receive offerings of a pice and a betel-nut
from travellers, while the <i>Khijado</i> and <i>Bāval</i> are given rags.”</p>

<p>In all these instances we notice the confusion of rags with
flags, but they unmistakably establish the point that the idea
underlying the offering is that of propitiating the spirit. A few
more instances may be cited from Crooke’s <i>Popular Religion and
Folklore of Northern India</i>. “Among the Mirzapur Korwas the
Baiga hangs rags on the trees which shade the village shrine, as
a charm to bring health and good luck. These rag shrines are
to be found all over the country, and are generally known as
<i>Chithariya</i> or <i>Chithraiya Bhavani</i>, ‘Our Lady of Tatters.’ So
in the Punjab the trees on which rags are hung are named after
Lingri Pir or the rag saint. The same custom prevails at various
Himalayan shrines and at the Vastra Harana or sacred tree at
Bindraban near Mathura which is now invested with a special
legend, as commemorating the place where Krishna carried off the
clothes of the milkmaids when they were bathing, an incident
which constantly appears in both European and Indian folklore.
In Berar a heap of stones daubed with red and placed under a
tree fluttering with rag represents Chindiya Deo or ‘the Lord of
Tatters,’ where, if you present a rag in due season, you may
chance to get new clothes.”</p>

<p>Crooke’s authority for this last instance is the <i>Gazetteer</i>, but as
indicated above these authorities have all missed the point
that the original conception was to honour the tree-spirit and that
these flags are hoisted either as a mark of reverence or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
as a thank-offering for cures from diseases and other boons and
further that these are regular flags and not scraps of shirts
and petticoats fixed on bushes or hung on trees, as in Europe.
During my recent journey from Rawalpindi to Kashmir I
saw several trees the boughs of which were decked with flags
of white and red cloth. In Baluchistan also I saw a good many
trees similarly decked with flags. In each case I found that
there was a grave of a saint underneath or close by the tree and
that the flags were hoisted in honour of the saint. There was
no suggestion of disease-transference, although the villagers
admitted that it was customary to offer these flags if, in
response to a prayer to the saint or a vow, any ailment
was cured. Everywhere the explanation given was the same.
The flag was presented to the saint only and solely as a thank-offering
for a wish fulfilled.</p>

<p>The cult of rag offering is believed to extend throughout
Africa from west to east. Park in his <i>Travels in the Interior of
Africa</i> says: “The company advanced as far as a large tree
called by the natives Neema Toba. It had a very singular appearance,
being covered with innumerable rags or scraps of cloth,
which persons travelling across the wilderness had at different
times tied to its branches, a custom so generally followed that no
one passes it without hanging up something.” Park adds that
he also followed the example, and suspended a handsome piece
of cloth on one of the boughs. Burton found the custom prevailing
in Arabia and Sir William Ouseley saw a tree close to a large
monolith covered with rags. Ferrier in his <i>Caravan Journeys</i>
says that these rags are fixed on bushes in Persia in the name
of Imam Raza. It is believed that the eye of the Imam being
always on the top of the mountain, the shreds which are left there
by those who hold him in reverence remind him of what he ought
to do in their behalf with Muhammad, Ali and the other holy
personages, who are able to propitiate the Almighty in their
favour. Hannay regarded these rags as charms for disease-transference.
In his <i>Travels in Persia</i> he says: “After ten days’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
journey we arrived at a caravanserai, where we found nothing but
water. I observed a tree with a number of rags tied to the branches:
these were so many charms which passengers coming from
Ghilan, a province remarkable for agues, had left there, in a
fond expectation of leaving their disease also on the same spot.”</p>

<p>This evidence, however, needs corroboration. Meanwhile, considering
how dangerous it is to generalise on the strength of stray
statements and observations of foreigners, considering how
these statements reveal only half-truths in the case of many
Indian customs, we may take this evidence with caution. If,
however, what Hannay says is based on the actual practices and
beliefs of the Persian Mahomedans, we are led to infer that not
only in several places in Europe but also in many parts of Asia
the rag came to be regarded as a vehicle of disease, whatever
may have been the original ideas underlying the offering. When
we have evidence to show that in Europe pins and rags were
used at wells for purposes of divination, it is not difficult to conceive
the process of reasoning by which these articles came to
be regarded as appropriate offerings to the indwelling spirits,
no matter how insignificant their intrinsic value. These instruments
of divination, having done their duty, must have been
consigned to the waters as being the best place for depositing them.
Then, probably, they were looked upon as indispensable offerings
to the water goblins and then, although the practice of divination
disappeared, these articles still came to be regarded as appropriate
offerings for the well-spirits, and the rustic mind, ignorant
of the genealogy of the custom, interpreted the survival of
the ancient usages according to its own conception of sympathetic
magic and either looked upon the rag-offering as a charm for
disease-transference, or as a connecting link with the deity.
This theory of the origin of the custom, which is here put forward
with some diffidence, also explains the growth of the two
conflicting theories (1) that the rags are vehicles of disease
or charms for disease-transference, and (2) that they are simple
offerings to propitiate the deity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>We have rambled far in our survey of the cult of rag offerings,
because it represents a peculiarly interesting phase of water-worship.
Of the rituals practised in the worship of water divinities
it is the most rude and primitive. While the ceremonies
of well-worship in the west correspond in several details, notably
the offerings of flowers and coins, to the rituals with which we
are familiar in this country, they contain some distinctive
elements, the most remarkable of which is this practice of rag-offerings.
We have cited numerous instances to show how
common the practice was in Great Britain and Ireland and
how it survives even to this day in certain parts, but while it
was and still is a general feature of water-worship in those
parts, it was and is unknown in India, although some folklorists
have erroneously identified it with the entirely different, though
seemingly analogous, practice of hoisting flags or <i>dhajas</i> at
shrines and sacred trees. Perhaps the best explanation for the
practice of rag-offering is that it may be a degenerate form
of flag-offering.</p>

<span class="smaller">ANIMAL DEITIES OF WATER.</span></h3>

<p>The western practices and customs we have noticed show that
the cult of water-worship prevailed and survived throughout
the west in a primitive form, evidently in a coarser form than in
the east. The most remarkable feature of this rude worship is
the belief in the presence of animals or fish as the presiding spirits
or tutelary deities of the wells and it affords a very curious illustration
of the savagery of those days in Europe. Originally, the
worship was established for one great divinity of water. Later,
however, both in the east and in the west, the inhabitants of different
places came to believe in different spirits of water. Thus
did the wells and rivers and pools and tanks of India come to be
peopled by fairies and genii, goblins and witches, sayyids and
saints. All these are represented in the guardian spirits of the
wells and rivers and pools and tanks on the Continent. But our
western friends go a step further and fill these wells with numerous
animal gods which are very imperfectly represented in the waters
of the east.</p>

<p>We find a general belief amongst the Hindus that the
nether regions are inhabited by water snakes called Nags.
Such were the Kaliya Nag, who resided at the bottom of the
Jumna and attacked the infant Krishna by whom he was
driven from that place, also the Serpent King of Nepal,
Karkotaka, who dwelt in the lake Nagarasa when the divine
lotus of Adi Buddha floated on its surface. It is believed that
a pool at the temple or Treyugi Narayana in Garhwal is full
of snakes of a yellow colour which emerge from water to be
worshipped on the Nagpanchami day. Another belief equates
the Nags with a species of semi-divine beings, half men and half
serpents, who possess magnificent palaces under water. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Puranas are full of traditions relating to princes who visited
these palaces in watery regions and brought back beautiful
Nagkanyas, or daughters of Nags, therefrom. For instance,
Arjuna married a Nagkanya named Ulupi when he was living
in exile with his brothers.</p>

<p>No other animal water-gods are found in Hindu mythology.
In the west, however, the guardian spirits of pools and wells
are frogs and trouts and worms and flies. At the well on the
Devil’s Causeway, between Ruckley and the Acton, the devil
and his imps appear in the form of frogs; three frogs are
always seen together, and these are the imps; the largest frog,
representing the devil, appearing but seldom. The Fount of
Tober Kieran, near Kells, County Meath, in Ireland, rises in a
diminutive rough-sided basin of limestone of natural formation
and evidently untouched by a tool. In the water are a brace of
miraculous trout “which, according to tradition, have occupied
their narrow prison from time immemorial. They are said never
in the memory of man to have altered in size, and it is said of
them that their appearance is ever the same.”</p>

<p>In Galway there is a deep depression in the limestone called
“Pigeon Hole,” and the sacred rivulet running at the base of the
chasm is believed to contain a pair of enchanted trout, one of
which is said to have been captured some time ago by a trooper
and cooked, but upon the approach of cold steel “the creature
at once changed into a beautiful woman,” and was returned to
the stream. The well at Tullaghan, County Sligo, also harbours
a brace of miraculous trout, not always visible to ordinary eyes.
Similarly, at Bally Morereigh, in Dingle, County Kerry, is a sacred
well called Tober Monachan, where a salmon and eel appear to
those devotees whom the guardian spirits of the well wish to
favour. In Scotland at Kilbride in Skye was a well with one
trout. “The natives are very tender of it,” says Martin, “and
though they often chance to catch it in their wooden pails, they
are very careful to preserve it from being destroyed.” In the
well at Kilmore, in Lorn, were two fishes, black in colour, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
augmenting in size or number nor exhibiting any alteration of
colour, and the inhabitants of the place “doe call the saide fishes
Easg Saint, that is to say, holie fishes.”</p>

<p>Sir Laurence Gomme records other examples of a still more interesting
nature. If, says Dalyell, a certain worm in a medicinal
spring on the top of the hill in the parish of Strathdon were
found alive, it augured the recovery of a patient, and in a well of
Ardnacloich, in Appin, the patient, “if he bee to dye shall find
a dead worme therein or a quick one, if health bee to follow.”
These, there can be little doubt, are the former deities of the
spring thus reduced in status.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the presiding genius of
the well of St. Michael near the Church of Kirkmichael, in
Banffshire, who assumes the semblance of a fly, and who
is immortal and always present in the water. “To the eye of
ignorance,” says the local account, “he might sometimes appear
dead, but it was only a transmigration into a similar form,
which made little alteration to the real identity.” “It seems
impossible,” remarks Sir Laurence Gomme, “to mistake this
as an almost perfect example where the guardian deity of
the sacred spring is represented in animal form. More perfect
than any other example to be met with in Britain and its isles
is this singular description of the traditional peasant belief,
it lifts the whole evidence as to the identification of wells in
Britain as the shrine of ancient local deities into close parallel
with savage ideas and thought.” Professor Robertson Smith
points out that the divine life of the waters is believed to reside
in the sacred fish that inhabits them, and he gives numerous
examples analogous to the Scottish and Irish, but whether represented
by fish, or frog, or worm, or fly, in all their various
forms, the point of the legends is that the sacred source is either
inhabited by a demoniac being or imbued with demoniac life.</p>

<p>Here we may bring to a close our analysis of water-worship
in East and West. Enough evidence has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
adduced to establish the identity of ideas and usages connected
with the worship of water in India with those prevailing
in Europe, particularly in the British Isles. Of all the great
objects of nature water impressed people the most. It came
to be worshipped everywhere. The foundation of the cult everywhere
was the same. The forms and rituals were, therefore, part
and parcel of the same common cult. There is, however, a
difference in the degree in which they have survived in different
places according to the stage of culture attained by the inhabitants
of the place. These variations enable us to compare the
stages of culture of different communities at different intervals,
stages of culture which are practically lost to history, but to
which folklore affords many a clue. In the legendary lore and
traditional materials known as folklore there are precious fragments
of information from which can be reared enduring monuments
of history if these are carefully handled and scientifically
sifted. The value, therefore, of these seemingly unmeaning
beliefs and customs to the student of ethnology and folklore
cannot be over-estimated, and this, if nothing else, may be
pleaded in justification of the author’s attempt to revive the
dying fame of the miraculous pools and rivers and their wonder-working
denizens.</p>

The sacredness of its source, so near the spring of the holy Godaveri,
attracted to the banks of the Vaitarana some of the first Aryan settlers.
Seers like Narad, Vashistha and Indra betook themselves to the spring
and the superhuman Yakshas, Gandharvas and Kinnars were attracted

gods and demi-gods for tolerating a tempest. It is quoted by Herbert Spencer in his
“Study of Sociology,” from Captain Burton’s account of Goa to show how awe of
power sways men’s religious beliefs:—</p>

<p>“A pot of oil with a lighted wick was placed every night by the half-bred Portuguese
Indians, before the painted doll, the patron saint of the boat in which we sailed
from Goa. One evening, as the weather appeared likely to be squally, we observed
that the usual compliment was not offered to the patron, and had the curiosity to
inquire why. ‘Why,’ vociferated the tindal (captain), indignantly, ‘if that chap can’t
keep the sky clear, he shall have neither oil nor wick from me, d—n him!’ ‘But I
should have supposed that in the hour of danger you would have paid him more than
usual attention?’ ‘The fact is, Sahib, I have found out that the fellow is not worth
his salt: the last time we had an infernal squall with him on board, and if he does not
keep this one off, I’ll just throw him overboard, and take to Santa Caterina; hang
me if I don’t—the brother-in-law!’” [Brother-in-law, a common term of insult.]</p>
